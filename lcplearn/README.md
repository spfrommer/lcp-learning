# LCP Learning Projects
This repository contains various toy LCP examples that I've been working through. There are two supported simulation types: falling box, and sliding box. See the notes for the details.

Unfortunately the lcp solver I use needs python 2, so the data generation is in python2 and the training is in python3. To view the sliding sim, for example, run:

python2 gen.py sliding

python3 trainin.py sliding
