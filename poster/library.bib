abstract = {This work explores the collision process at foot contact in models of legged robots. In particular, we highlight that for legged systems the widely used assumption of no sliding of the contact points can yield inconsistent outcomes. For certain contact configurations and system parameters, neither the assumption of lift-off of the trailing foot nor the assumption that it stays fixed on the ground yield valid solutions. The foot will slide, even if an infinite coefficient of friction is assumed. In a related effect, we present configurations in which the solution of the collision process is ambiguous. These behaviors are examined for the models of a minimalistic biped, a passive dynamic walker, and the five-link bipedal robot RAMone. The paper provides background for these non-intuitive behaviors and investigates the influence of system parameters onto the collision behavior of a passive dynamic walker. By studying bipedal models that range from minimalistic to physically accurate, this paper establishes a...},

abstract = {—In this paper, we present and verify methods for developing robust, high-level policies for metastable (i.e., rarely falling) rough-terrain robot walking. We focus on simultaneously addressing the important, real-world challenges of (1) use of a tractable mesh, to avoid the curse of dimensionality and (2) maintaining near-optimal performance that is robust to uncertainties. Toward our first goal, we present an improved meshing technique, which captures the step-to-step dynamics of robot walking as a discrete-time Markov chain with a small number of points. We keep our methods and analysis generic, and illustrate robustness by quantifying the stability of resulting control policies derived through our methods. To demonstrate our approach, we focus on the challenge of optimally switching among a finite set of low-level controllers for underactuated, rough-terrain walking. Via appropriate meshing techniques, we see that even terrain-blind switching between multiple controllers increases the stability of the robot, while lookahead (terrain information) makes this improvement dramatic. We deal with both noise on the lookahead information and on the state of the robot. These two robustness requirements are essential for our methods to be applicable to real high-DOF robots, which is the primary motivation of the authors.},

abstract = {One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, these dynamics are described by physics-based analytical models, which may however be very hard to find for complex problems. More recently, we have seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of more complex physical interactions directly from sensory input. However, it is an open question how far these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we analyse how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of both worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which there exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We propose to use a neural network to convert the raw sensory data into a suitable representation that can be consumed by the analytical model and compare this approach to using neural networks for both, perception and prediction. Our results show that the combined method outperforms the purely learned version in terms of accuracy and generalization to push actions not seen during training. It also performs comparable to the analytical model applied on ground truth input values, despite using raw sensory data as input.},

abstract = {Control of grasp stability under different frictional conditions has primarily been studied in manipulatory tasks involving two digits only. Recently we found that many of the principles for control of forces originally demonstrated for two-digit grasping also apply to various three-digit grasps. Here we examine the control of grasp stability in a multidigit task in which subjects used the tips of the thumb, index, and middle finger to lift an object. The grasp resembled those used when lifting a cylindrical object from above. The digits either all contacted the same surface material or one of the digits contacted a surface material that was more, or less, slippery than that contacted by the other two digits. The three-dimensional forces and torques applied by each digit and the contact positions were measured along with the position and orientation of the object. The distribution of forces among the digits strongly reflected constraints imposed by the geometric relationship between the object's center of mass and the contact surfaces. On top of this distribution, we observed changes in force coordination related to changes in the combination of surface materials. When all digits contacted the same surface material, the ratio between the normal force and tangential load (F(n):L ratio) was similar across digits and scaled to provide an adequate safety margin against slip. With different contact surfaces subjects adapted the F(n):L ratios at the individual digits to the local friction with only small influences by the friction at the other two digits. They accomplished this by scaling the normal forces similarly at all digits and changing the distribution of load among the digits. The surface combination did not, however, influence digit position, tangential torque, or object tilting systematically. The change in load distribution, rather, resulted from interplay between these factors, and the nature of this interplay varied between trials. That is, subjects achieved grasp stability with various combinations of fingertip actions and appeared to exploit the many degrees of freedom offered by the multidigit grasp. The results extend previous findings based on two-digit tasks to multidigit tasks by showing that subjects adjust fingertip forces at each digit to the local friction. Moreover, our findings suggest that subjects adapted the load distribution to the current frictional condition by regulating the normal forces to allow slips to occur early in the lift task, prior to object lift-off.},

abstract = { A motion planning algorithm is described for bounding over rough terrain with the LittleDog robot. Unlike walking gaits,
bounding is highly dynamic and cannot be planned with quasi-steady approximations. LittleDog is modeled as a planar
five-link system, with a 16-dimensional state space; computing a plan over rough terrain in this high-dimensional state
space that respects the kinodynamic constraints due to underactuation and motor limits is extremely challenging. Rapidly
Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are known for fast kinematic path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces in
the presence of obstacles, but search efficiency degrades rapidly with the addition of challenging dynamics. A computationally
tractable planner for bounding was developed by modifying the RRT algorithm by using: (1) motion primitives to
reduce the dimensionality of the problem; (2) Reachability Guidance, which dynamically changes the sampling distribution
and distance metric to address differential constraints and discontinuous motion primitive dynamics; and (3) sampling
with a Voronoi bias in a lower-dimensional �task space� for bounding. Short trajectories were demonstrated to work on
the robot, however open-loop bounding is inherently unstable. A feedback controller based on transverse linearization was
implemented, and shown in simulation to stabilize perturbations in the presence of noise and time delays. },

abstract = { In the rst part of this thesis, we introduce a specic class of Linear Matrix Inequalities
(LMI) whose optimal solution can be characterized exactly. This family
corresponds to the case where the associated linear operator maps the cone of positive
semidenite matrices onto itself. In this case, the optimal value equals the
spectral radius of the operator. It is shown that some rank minimization problems,
as well as generalizations of the structured singular value (mu) LMIs, have exactly
this property.
In the same spirit of exploiting structure to achieve computational efficiency,
an algorithm for the numerical solution of a special class of frequency-dependent
LMIs is presented. These optimization problems arise from robustness analysis
questions, via the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma. The procedure is an outer
approximation method based on the algorithms used in the computation of H1
norms for linear, time invariant systems. The result is especially useful for systems
with large state dimension.
The other main contribution in this thesis is the formulation of a convex optimization
framework for semialgebraic problems, i.e., those that can be expressed by
polynomial equalities and inequalities. The key element is the interaction of concepts
in real algebraic geometry (Positivstellensatz) and semidenite programming.

To this end, an LMI formulation for the sums of squares decomposition for
multivariable polynomials is presented. Based on this, it is shown how to construct
sufficient Positivstellensatz-based convex tests to prove that certain sets are empty.
Among other applications, this leads to a nonlinear extension of many LMI based
results in uncertain linear system analysis.
Within the same framework, we develop stronger criteria for matrix copositivity,
and generalizations of the well-known standard semidenite relaxations for quadratic
programming.
Some applications to new and previously studied problems are presented. A few
examples are Lyapunov function computation, robust bifurcation analysis, structured
singular values, etc. It is shown that the proposed methods allow for improved
solutions for very diverse questions in continuous and combinatorial optimization. },

abstract = {Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning of rigid-body systems that contact their environment through inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints. We leverage Sequential Quadratic Programming to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high-dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high-speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

abstract = {Contact dynamics are commonly formulated as a linear complementarity problem. While this approach is superior to earlier spring-damper models, it can be inaccurate due to pyramid approximations to the friction cone, and inefficient due to lack of convexity coupled with a large number of auxiliary variables. Here we propose a new approach: implicit complementarity. Instead of treating contact velocities and forces as independent variables subject to explicit complementarity constraints, we express them as functions of a minimal set of unconstrained variables, and design these functions so that the complementarity constraints are automatically satisfied. We then solve the equations of motion via a non-smooth Gauss-Newton method augmented with an original linesearch procedure which exploits the problem structure. This enables us to represent the friction cone exactly and to reduce the number of unknowns by about a factor of 3. Numerical tests suggest that, in usage scenarios typical for robotics, the solver takes only about 5 iterations even without warm starts. More extensive tests and side-by-side comparisons remain to be done, but nevertheless the potential of the new approach is clear.},

Our optimization technique converges over a wider range of input paths and is able to optimize higher-order dynamics of trajectories than previous path optimization strategies.

abstract = { While legged animals are adept at traversing
rough landscapes, it remains a very challenging task for a
legged robot to negotiate unknown terrain. Control systems
for legged robots are plagued by dynamic constraints from
underactuation, actuator power limits, and frictional ground
contact; rather than relying purely on disturbance rejection,
considerable advantage can be obtained by planning nominal
trajectories which are more easily stabilized. In this paper, we
present an approach for designing nominal periodic trajectories
for legged robots that maximize a measure of robustness against
uncertainty in the geometry of the terrain. We propose a direct
collocation method which solves simultaneously for a nominal
periodic control input, for many possible one-step solution
trajectories (using ground profiles drawn from a distribution
over terrain), and for the periodic solution to a jump Riccati
equation which provides an expected infinite-horizon cost-to-go
for each of these samples. We demonstrate that this trajectory
optimization scheme can recover the known deadbeat open-
loop control solution for the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum

generalizes to other models like the bipedal compass gait walker,
resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of steps taken
over moderate terrain when compared against a limit cycle
optimized for efficiency only.

abstract = { The construction of feedback control laws for underactuated nonlinear robotic systems with
input saturation limits is crucial for dynamic robotic tasks such as walking, running, or flying.
Existing techniques for feedback control design are either restricted to linear systems, rely on
discretizations of the state space, or require solving a non-convex optimization problem that
requires feasible initialization. This paper presents a method for designing feedback controllers for polynomial systems that maximize the size of the time�limited backwards reachable set (BRS). In contrast to traditional approaches based on Lyapunov�s criteria for stability, we
rely on the notion of occupation measures to pose this problem as an infinite�dimensional linear program which can then be approximated in finite dimension via semidefinite programs (SDP)s. The solution to each SDP yields a polynomial control policy and an outer approximation of the largest achievable BRS which is well-suited for use in a trajectory library or feedback motion planning algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on six nonlinear systems. Comparisons to an infinite�horizon linear quadratic regulator approach and
an approach relying on Lyapunov�s criteria for stability are also included in order to illustrate
the improved performance of the presented technique.

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic approach for the design of continuous-time controllers to robustly and exponentially stabilize periodic orbits of hybrid dynamical systems arising from bipedal walking. A parameterized family of continuous-time controllers is assumed so that (1) a periodic orbit is induced for the hybrid system, and (2) the orbit is invariant under the choice of controller parameters. Properties of the Poincar{\'{e}} map and its first- and second-order derivatives are used to translate the problem of exponential stabilization of the periodic orbit into a set of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). A BMI optimization problem is then set up to tune the parameters of the continuous-time controller so that the Jacobian of the Poincar{\'{e}} map has its eigenvalues in the unit circle. It is also shown how robustness against uncertainty in the switching condition of the hybrid system can be incorporated into the design problem.

abstract = {ABSTRACTIn this paper, we propose a fast optimisation algorithm for approximately minimising convex quadratic functions over the intersection of affine and separable constraints (i.e. the Cartesian product of possibly nonconvex real sets). This problem class contains many NP-hard problems such as mixed-integer quadratic programming. Our heuristic is based on a variation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), an algorithm for solving convex optimisation problems. We discuss the favourable computational aspects of our algorithm, which allow it to run quickly even on very modest computational platforms such as embedded processors. We give several examples for which an approximate solution should be found very quickly, such as management of a hybrid-electric vehicle drivetrain and control of switched-mode power converters. Our numerical experiments suggest that our method is very effective in finding a feasible point with small objective value; indeed, we see that in many cases, it finds t...},

abstract = { A novel control method for biped locomotion on rugged terrain is introduced, assuming an ideal robot model which has massless legs. By applying constraint control to the robot body so that it moves on a particular straight line and rotates at a constant angular velocity, the dynamics of the center of mass of the body becomes completely linear. Such motion of the ideal model is called the linear inverted pendulum mode, and it is used to develop the control scheme of the biped walking on rugged terrain. Under the control method in the linear inverted pendulum mode, walking on a particular rugged ground is shown to be equivalent to walking on a level ground. It is also shown that the additional use of the ankle torque makes the proposed control scheme robust and applicable to a real biped robot with mass legs. Simulation results are presented. },

combination of synunetric matrices is positive semidefinite. Such a constraint is nonlinear and nonsmooth, but convex,

problems (e.g., linear and quadratic programming) and finds many applications in engineering and combinatorial
optimization.
Although semidefinite programs are much more general than linear programs, they are not much harder to solve.
Most interior-point methods for linear programming have been generalized to semidefinite programs. As in linear
programming, these methods have polynomial worst-case complexity and perform very well in practice.
This paper gives a survey of the theory and applications of semidefinite programs and an introduction to primaldual
interior-point methods for their solution. },

abstract = { In this paper we seek to quantify and explicitly
optimize the robustness of a control system for a robot walking
on terrain with uncertain geometry. Geometric perturbations to
the terrain enter the equations of motion through a relocation of
the hybrid event guards which trigger an impact event; these
perturbations can have a large effect on the stability of the robot
and do not fit into the traditional robust control analysis and
design methodologies without additional machinery. We attempt
to provide that machinery here. In particular, we quantify the
robustness of the system to terrain perturbations by defining
an L2 gain from terrain perturbations to deviations from the
nominal limit cycle. We show that the solution to a periodic
dissipation inequality provides a sufficient upper bound on
this gain for a linear approximation of the dynamics around
the limit cycle, and we formulate a semidefinite programming
problem to compute the L2 gain for the system with a fixed
linear controller. We then use either binary search or an
iterative optimization method to construct a linear robust
controller and to minimize the L2 gain. The simulation results
on canonical robots suggest that the L2 gain is closely correlated
to the actual number of steps traversed on the rough terrain,
and our controller can improve the robot�s robustness to terrain
disturbances.

Methods based on sums-of-squares (SOS) for numerical computation of Lyapunov certificates are a powerful tool for analyzing the stability of continuous nonlinear systems, and can additionally be used to automatically synthesize stabilizing feedback controllers. Here, we present a method for applying sums-of-squares verification to rigid bodies with Coulomb friction undergoing discontinuous, inelastic impact events. The proposed algorithm explicitly generates Lyapunov certificates for stability, positive invariance, and safety over admissible (non-penetrating) states and contact forces. We leverage the complementarity formulation of contact, which naturally generates the semialgebraic constraints that define this admissible region. The approach is demonstrated on multiple robotics examples, including simple models of a walking robot, a perching aircraft, and control design of a balancing robot. },

We present physics-based running motions for complex models of human-like running in three dimensions that have been generated by optimization. Running is modeled as a multiphase periodic motion with discontinuities, based on multibody system models of the locomotor system with actuators and spring-damper elements at each joint. The problem of generating gaits is formulated as offline optimal control problem and solved by an efficient direct multiple shooting method. We present optimization results using energy-related criteria and show that they have a close resemblance to running motions of humans.

Our main contribution lies in producing constraint-satisfaction guaranteed motions for any time grid. Indeed, we use Taylor series expansion to approximate the dynamic and kinematic models over fixed successive time intervals, and transform the problem (constraints and cost functions) into time polynomials which coefficients are function of the optimization variables. The evaluation of the constraints turns then into computation of extrema (over each time interval) that are given to the solver. We also account for collisions and self-collisions constraints that have not a closed-form expression over the time. We address the problem of the balance within the optimization problem and demonstrate that generating whole-body multi-contact dynamic motion for complex tasks is possible and can be tractable, although still time consuming.

Owing to limited energy budgets and limited control authority, these disturbances cannot always be canceled out with high-gain feedback. Minimally actuated walking machines subject to stochastic disturbances no longer satisfy strict conditions for limit-cycle stability; however, they can still demonstrate impressively long-living periods of continuous walking. Here, we employ tools from stochastic processes to examine the stochastic stability of idealized rimless-wheel and compass-gait walking on randomly generated uneven terrain. Furthermore, we employ tools from numerical stochastic optimal control to design a controller for an actuated compass gait model which maximizes a measure of stochastic stability - the mean first-passage time - and compare its performance with a deterministic counterpart. Our results demonstrate that walking is well characterized as a metastable process, and that the stochastic dynamics of walking should be accounted for during control design in order to improve the stability of our machines. },

Examples include robots that grasp the solar panels of space craft, handle large panels in manufacturing, or climb or perch on surfaces. We present a solution for grasping such surfaces consisting of groups of tiles coated with a controllable gecko-inspired adhesive. The tiles are loaded with two sets of tendons: one for distributing the forces evenly while grasping and the other for release. The gripper is passive and can attach and detach with little effort so that it does not disturb either the robot or the object to be grasped. The maximum gripping force in the normal direction can be over 1000 times greater than the required detaching force. The gripper is also fast, allowing a flying quadrotor to attach to a surface milliseconds after the tiles make contact. We present a ...},

abstract = { Bipedal robots are difficult to analyze mathematically. However, successful control strategies can be discovered using simple physical intuition and can be described in simple terms. Five things have to happen for a planar bipedal robot to walk. Height has to be stabilized. Pitch has to be stabilized. Speed has to be stabilized. The swing leg has to move so that the feet are in locations which allow for the stability of height, pitch, and speed. Finally, transitions from support leg to support leg must occur at appropriate times. If these ve objectives are achieved, the robot will walk. A number of different intuitive control strategies can be used to achieve each of these five objectives. Further, each strategy can be implemented in a variety of ways. We present several strategies for each objective which we have implemented onabipedal walking robot. Using these simple intuitive strategies, we have compelled a seven link planar bipedal robot, called Spring Flamingo, to walk. The robot walks both slowly and quickly, walks over moderate obstacles, starts, and stops. Video, photographs, and more information on Spring Flamingo can be found at http://www.leglab.ai.mit.edu/ },

abstract = { The planar bipedal testbed MABEL contains springs in its drivetrain for the purpose of enhancing both energy efficiency and agility of dynamic locomotion. While the potential energetic benefits of springs are well documented in the literature, feedback control designs that effectively realize this potential are lacking. In this paper, we extend and apply the methods of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics, originally developed for rigid robots with a single degree of underactuation, to MABEL, a bipedal walker with a novel compliant transmission and multiple degrees of underactuation. A time-invariant feedback controller is designed such that the closed-loop system respects the natural compliance of the open-loop system and realizes exponentially stable walking gaits. Five experiments are presented that highlight different aspects of MABEL and the feedback design method, ranging from basic elements such as stable walking and robustness under perturbations, to energy efficiency and a bipedal robot walking speed record of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph). The experiments also compare two feedback implementations of the virtual constraints, one based on PD control as on RABBIT, and a second that implements the full hybrid zero dynamics controller. On MABEL, the full hybrid zero dynamics controller yields a much more faithful realization of the desired virtual constraints and was instrumental in achieving more rapid walking. },

To this end, we use reinforcement learning to create models of human behavior during assistance with dressing. To explore this kind of interaction, we assume that the robot presents an open sleeve of a hospital gown to a person, and that the person moves their arm into the sleeve. The controller that models the person's behavior is given the position of the end of the sleeve and information about contact between the person's hand and the fabric of the gown. We simulate this system with a human torso model that has realistic joint ranges, a simple robot gripper, and a physics-based cloth model for the gown. Through reinforcement learning (specifically the TRPO algorithm) the system creates a model of human behavior that is capable of placing the arm into the sleeve. We aim to model what humans are capable of doing, rather than what they typically do. We demonstrate successfully trained human behaviors for three robot-assisted dressing strategies: 1) the robot gripper holds the sleeve motionless, 2) the gripper moves the sleeve linearly towards the person from the front, and 3) the gripper moves the sleeve linearly from the side.},

The limit surface, from classical plasticity theory, is the surface in load space which bounds the set of all possible frictional forces and moments that can be sustained by the frictional interface. Zhukovskii's moment function (N. E. Zhukovskii, Collected Works, Vol. 1, Gostekhizdat, Moscow, 1948, pp. 339-354) is the net frictional moment about the body's instantaneous center of rotation as a function of its location. Both of these descriptions implicitly contain the full relation between slip motion and frictional load. While Zhukovskii's moment function applies only to ordinary isotropic Coulomb friction, the limit surface applies to a wider class of friction laws that includes, for example, contact mediated by massless rigid wheels. Both the limit surface and the moment function can be used to deduce results concerning the motion of sliding rigid bodies.},

These techniques have been recently extended to nonlinear systems with polynomial or rational dynamics through the use of sum of squares (SOS) programming.
In this paper we further extend the class of systems that can be analyzed with convexity-based methods. We show how to analyze the robust stability properties of uncertain nonlinear systems with polynomial or rational dynamics, via contraction analysis and SOS programming. Since the existence of a global contraction metric is a sufficient condition for global stability of an autonomous system, we develop an algorithm for finding such contraction metrics using SOS programming. The search process is made computationally tractable by relaxing matrix definiteness constraints, the feasibility of which indicates the existence of a contraction metric, to SOS constraints on polynomial matrices. We illustrate our results through examples from the literature and show how our contraction-based approach offers advantages when compared with traditional Lyapunov analysis. },

In our model, time and configuration are fixed, but the impact is resolved into distinct compression and expansion phases, themselves comprising sliding and rolling intervals. A constrained optimization problem is solved for each interval to compute incremental impulses while respecting physical laws and principles of contact mechanics. We present the mathematical model, algorithms for its practical implementation, and examples that demonstrate its effectiveness. In collisions involving materials of various stiffnesses, our model can be more than 20 times faster than integrating through the collision using a compliant contact model.

abstract = {How can a robot design a sequence of grasping actions that will succeed despite the presence of bounded state uncertainty and an inherently stochastic system? In this paper, we propose a probabilistic algorithm that generates sequential actions to iteratively reduce uncertainty until object pose is uniquely known (subject to symmetry). The plans assume encoder feedback that gives a geometric partition of the post-grasp configuration space based on contact conditions. An offline planning tree is generated by interleaving com-putationally tractable open-loop action sequence search and feedback state estimation with particle filtering. To speed up planning, we use learned approximate forward motion models, sensor models, and collision detectors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on robotic experiments with over 3000 grasp sequences using different object shapes, pressure distributions, and gripper materials where the uncertainty region is comparable to the size of the object in translation and with no information about orientation.},

abstract = {Hybrid zero dynamics extends the Byrnes-Isidori notion of zero dynamics to a class of hybrid models called systems with impulse effects. Specifically, given a smooth submanifold that is contained in the zero set of an output function and is invariant under both the continuous flow of the system with impulse effects as well as its reset map, the restriction dynamics is called the hybrid zero dynamics. Prior results on the stabilization of periodic orbits of the hybrid zero dynamics have relied on input-output linearization of the transverse variables. The principal result of this paper shows how control Lyapunov functions can be used to exponentially stabilize periodic orbits of the hybrid zero dynamics, thereby significantly extending the class of stabilizing controllers. An illustration of this result on a model of a bipedal walking robot is provided.},

The model can also accommodate articulated robot hands with joint torques, joint frictions, and spring preloads.

@article{Srinivasan06,
abstract = { Although people's legs are capable of a broad
range of muscle-use and gait patterns, they generally
prefer just two. They walk, swinging their body
over a relatively straight leg with each step, or run,
bouncing up off a bent leg between aerial phases.
Walking feels easiest when going slowly, and running
feels easiest when going faster. More unusual
gaits seemmore tiring. Perhaps this is because walking
and running use the least energy [1; 2; 3; 4; 5;
6; 7]. Addressing this classic [1] conjecture with experiments
[2; 3] requires comparing walking and
running with many other strange and unpracticed
gaits. As an alternative, a basic understanding of
gait choice might be obtained by calculating energy
cost by using mechanics-based models. Here
we use a minimal model that can describe walking
and running as well as an infinite variety of other
gaits. We use computer optimization to find which
gaits are indeed energetically optimal for thismodel.
At low speeds the optimization discovers the classic
inverted-pendulum walk [8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13], at
high speeds it discovers a bouncing run [12; 14]1,
even without springs, and at intermediate speeds
it finds a new pendular-running gait that includes
walking and running as extreme cases. },

abstract = { Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally
optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion
and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environ-
ment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result
from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a
specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for
trajectory planning of rigid body systems that contact their environment through
inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement
for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dy-
namics as a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) for forward simulation, the
proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program
with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). We leverage Sequential Quadratic
Programming (SQP) to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simul-
taneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints.
The method scales well to high dimensional systems with large numbers of possi-
ble modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems:
rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar
walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high speed bipedal running on the
FastRunner platform. },

Particularly, we consider the problem of manipulating a grasped object using external pushes for which the pusher sticks to the object. Given the physical properties of the object, frictional coefficients at contacts and a desired regrasp on the object, we propose a sampling-based planning framework that builds a pushing strategy concatenating different feasible stable pushes to achieve the desired regrasp. An efficient dynamics formulation for stable prehensile pushing allows us to plan in-hand manipulations 100-1000 times faster than our previous work which builds upon a complementarity formulation. Experimental observations for the generated plans show very close correspondence to the expected results from the planner. Video Summary -- youtu.be/qOTKRJMx6Ho},

abstract = {Recently, a number of grasp detection methods have been proposed that can be used to localize robotic grasp configurations directly from sensor data without estimating object pose. The underlying idea is to treat grasp perception analogously to object detection in computer vision. These methods take as input a noisy and partially occluded RGBD image or point cloud and produce as output pose estimates of viable grasps, without assuming a known CAD model of the object. Although these methods generalize grasp knowledge to new objects well, they have not yet been demonstrated to be reliable enough for wide use. Many grasp detection methods achieve grasp success rates (grasp successes as a fraction of the total number of grasp attempts) between 75{\%} and 95{\%} for novel objects presented in isolation or in light clutter. Not only are these success rates too low for practical grasping applications, but the light clutter scenarios that are evaluated often do not reflect the realities of real world grasping. This paper proposes a number of innovations that together result in a significant improvement in grasp detection performance. The specific improvement in performance due to each of our contributions is quantitatively measured either in simulation or on robotic hardware. Ultimately, we report a series of robotic experiments that average a 93{\%} end-to-end grasp success rate for novel objects presented in dense clutter.},

@article{Burstedt1997,
abstract = {We investigated the coordination of fingertip forces in subjects who used the tips of two fingers to restrain an instrumented manipulandum with horizontally oriented grip surfaces. The grip surfaces were subjected to tangential pulling forces in the distal direction in relation to the fingers. The subjects used either the right index and middle fingers (unimanual grasp) or both index fingers (bimanual grasp) to restrain the manipulandum. To change the frictional condition at the digit-object interfaces, either both grip surfaces were covered with sandpaper or one was covered with sandpaper and the other with rayon. The forces applied normally and tangentially to the grip surfaces were measured separately at each plate along with the position of the plates. Subjects could have performed the present task successfully with many different force distributions between the digits. However, they partitioned the load in a manner that reflected the frictional condition at the local digit-object interfaces. When both digits contacted sandpaper, they typically partitioned the load symmetrically, but when one digit made contact with rayon and the other with sandpaper, the digit contacting the less slippery material (sandpaper) took up a larger part of the load. The normal forces were also influenced by the frictional condition, but they reflected the average friction at the two contact sites rather than the local friction. That is, when friction was low at one of the digit-object interfaces, only the applied normal forces increased at both digits. Thus sensory information related to the local frictional condition at the respective digit-object interfaces controlled the normal force at both digits. The normal:tangential force ratio at each digit appeared to be a controlled variable. It was adjusted independently at each digit to the minimum ratio required to prevent frictional slippage, keeping an adequate safety margin against slippage. This was accomplished by the scaling of the normal forces to the average friction and by partitioning of the load according to frictional differences between the digit-object interfaces. In conclusion, by adjusting the normal:tangential force ratios to the local frictional condition, subjects avoided excessive normal forces at the individual digit-object interfaces, and by partitioning the load according the frictional difference, subjects avoided high normal forces. Thus the local frictional condition at the separate digit-object interfaces is one factor that can strongly influence the distribution of forces across digits engaged in a manipulative act.},

abstract = { This paper presents an approach to computing
the time-limited backwards reachable set (BRS) of a semialgebraic
target set for controlled polynomial hybrid systems with
semialgebraic state and input constraints. By relying on the
notion of occupation measures, the computation of the BRS of
a target set that may be distributed across distinct subsystems
of the hybrid system, is posed as an infinite dimensional linear
program (LP). Computationally tractable approximations to
this LP are constructed via a sequence of semidefinite programs
each of which is proven to construct an outer approximation
of the true BRS with asymptotically vanishing conservatism.
In contrast to traditional Lyapunov based approaches, the
presented approach is convex and does not require any form
of initialization. The performance of the presented algorithm
is illustrated on 2 nonlinear controlled hybrid systems. },

@phdthesis{Pratt00,
abstract = { Walking is an easy task for most humans and animals. Two characteristics which make it easy are the inherent robustness (tolerance to variation) of the walking problem and the natural dynamics of the walking mechanism. In this thesis we show how understanding and exploiting these two characteristics can aid in the control of bipedal robots. Inherent robustness allows for the use of simple, low impedance controllers. Natural dynamics reduces the requirements of the controller. We present a series of simple physical models of bipedal walking. The insight gained from these models is used in the development of three planar (motion only in the sagittal plane) control algorithms. The first uses simple strategies to control the robot to walk. The second exploits the natural dynamics of a kneecap, compliant ankle, and passive swing-leg. The third achieves fast swing of the swing-leg in order to enable the robot to walk quickly (1.25 m/s). These algorithms are implemented on Spring Flamingo, a planar bipedal walking robot, which was designed and built for this thesis. Using these algorithms, the robot can stand and balance, start and stop walking, walk at a range of speeds, and traverse slopes and rolling terrain. Three-dimensional walking on at ground is implemented and tested in simulation. The dynamics of the sagittal plane are sufficiently decoupled from the dynamics of the frontal and transverse planes such that control of each can be treated separately. We achieve three-dimensional walking by adding lateral balance to the planar algorithms. Tests of this approach on a real three-dimensional robot will lead to a more complete understanding of the control of bipedal walking in robots and humans. },

The forward dynamics of a 27-dof humanoid with 10 contacts are evaluated in 0.1 msec. Since the simulation is stable at 10 msec timesteps, it can run 100 times faster than real-time on a single core of a desktop processor. Furthermore the entire simulation pipeline can be inverted analytically, an order-of-magnitude faster than the corresponding forward dynamics. We soften all constraints, in a way that avoids instabilities and unrealistic penetrations associated with earlier spring-damper methods and yet is sufficient to allow inversion. Constraints are imposed via impulses, using an extended version of the velocity-stepping approach. For holomonic constraints the extension involves a soft version of the Gauss principle. For all other constraints we extend our earlier work on complementarity-free contact dynamics - which were already known to be invertible via an iterative solver - and develop a new formulation allowing analytical inversion.},

Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning through contact that eliminates the requirement for an $\backslash$emph{\{}a priori{\}} mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm leverages Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory and satisfying nonlinear complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes.

abstract = {The most widely used technique for generating whole-body motions on a humanoid robot accounting for various tasks and constraints is inverse kinematics. Based on the task-function approach, this class of methods enables the coordination of robot movements to execute several tasks in parallel and account for the sensor feedback in real time, thanks to the low computation cost. To some extent, it also enables us to deal with some of the robot constraints (e.g., joint limits or visibility) and manage the quasi-static balance of the robot. In order to fully use the whole range of possible motions, this paper proposes extending the task-function approach to handle the full dynamics of the robot multibody along with any constraint written as equality or inequality of the state and control variables. The definition of multiple objectives is made possible by ordering them inside a strict hierarchy. Several models of contact with the environment can be implemented in the framework. We propose a reduced formulation of the multiple rigid planar contact that keeps a low computation cost. The efficiency of this approach is illustrated by presenting several multicontact dynamic motions in simulation and on the real HRP-2 robot.},

abstract = { Recent trends pushing robots into unstructured environments with limited sensors have motivated considerable work on planning under uncertainty and stochastic optimal control, but these methods typically do not provide guaranteed performance. Here we consider the problem of bounding the probability of failure (defined as leaving a finite region of state space) over a finite time for stochastic non-linear systems with continuous state. Our approach searches for exponential barrier functions that provide bounds using a variant of the classical supermartingale result. We provide a relaxation of this search to a semidefinite program, yielding an efficient algorithm that provides rigorous upper bounds on the probability of failure for the original non-linear system. We give a number of numerical examples in both discrete and continuous time that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. },

abstract = { This paper presents numerical methods for computing regions of finite-time invariance (funnels) around solutions of polynomial differential equations. First, we present a method which exactly certifies sufficient conditions for invariance despite relying on approximate trajectories from numerical integration. Our second method relaxes the constraints of the first by sampling in time. In applications, this can recover almost identical funnels but is much faster to compute. In both cases, funnels are verified using Sum-of-Squares programming to search over a family of time-varying polynomial Lyapunov functions. Initial candidate Lyapunov functions are constructed using the linearization about the trajectory, and associated time-varying Lyapunov and Riccati differential equations. The methods are compared on stabilized trajectories of a six-state model of a satellite. },

abstract = { The control of complex non-linear systems can be aided by modeling each system as a collection of simplified hybrid modes, with each mode representing a particular operating regime defined by the system dynamics or by a region of the state space in which the system operates. Guarantees on the safety and performance of such hybrid systems can still be challenging to generate, however. Reachability analysis using a dynamic game formulation with Hamilton$\backslash$96Jacobi methods provides a useful way to generate these types of guarantees, and the technique is flexible enough to analyze a wide variety of systems. This paper presents two applications of reachable sets, both focused on guaranteeing the safety and performance of robotic aerial vehicles. In the first example, reachable sets are used to design and implement a backflip maneuver for a quadrotor helicopter. In the second, reachability analysis is used to design a decentralized collision avoidance algorithm for multiple quadrotors. The theory for both examples is explained, and successful experimental results are presented from flight tests on the STARMAC quadrotor helicopter platform.

We also demonstrate that a one-step time horizon control strategy using the same low-level controller can provide performance which is surprisingly comparable to that of the infinite time horizon optimal policy. The model presented here uses a torque at the hip and an axially-directed impulsive toe-off applied just before each ground collision.

abstract = { Maintaining balance is fundamental to legged robots. The most commonly used mechanisms for balance control are taking a step, regulating the center of pressure (ankle strategies), and to a lesser extent, changing centroidal angular momentum (e.g., hip strategies). In this paper, we disregard these three mechanisms, instead focusing on a fourth: varying center of mass height. We study a 2D variable-height center of mass model, and analyze how center of mass height variation can be used to achieve balance, in the sense of convergence to a fixed point of the dynamics. In this analysis, we pay special attention to the constraint of unilateral contact forces. We first derive a necessary condition that must be satisfied to be able to achieve balance. We then present two control laws, and derive their regions of attraction in closed form. We show that one of the control laws achieves balance from any state satisfying the necessary condition for balance. Finally, we briefly discuss the relative importance of CoM height variation and other balance mechanisms. },

We consider this ability to be crucial to legged locomotion and a useful, yet not overly restrictive criterion for stability. In this part (Part 1), we introduce a theoretical framework for assessing N-step capturability. This framework is used to analyze three simple models of legged locomotion. All three models are based on the 3D Linear Inverted Pendulum Model. The first model relies solely on a point foot step location to maintain balance, the second model adds a finite-sized foot, and the third model enables the use of centroidal angular momentum by adding a reaction mass. We analyze how these mechanisms influence N-step capturability, for any N {\textgreater} 0. Part 2 will show that these results can be used to control a humanoid robot. },

The approach is based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation, where the goal is to find an optimal sequence of robot motions to achieve a desired object motion. Due to the multiple contact modes associated with frictional interactions, the resulting optimization program suffers from combinatorial complexity when tasked with determining the optimal sequence of modes. To overcome this difficulty, we formulate the search for the optimal mode sequences offline, separately from the search for optimal control inputs online. Using tools from machine learning, this leads to a convex hybrid MPC program that can be solved in real-time.

abstract = { A methodology for safety verification of continuous and hybrid systems using barrier certificates has been proposed recently. Conditions that must be satisfied by a barrier certificate can be formulated as a convex program, and the feasibility of the program implies system safety in the sense that there is no trajectory starting from a given set of initial states that reaches a given unsafe region. The dual of this problem, i.e., the reachability problem, concerns proving the existence of a trajectory starting from the initial set that reaches another given set. Using insights from the linear programming duality appearing in the discrete shortest path problem, we show in this paper that reachability of continuous systems can also be verified through convex programming. Several convex programs for verifying safety and reachability, as well as other temporal properties such as eventuality, avoidance, and their combinations, are formulated. Some examples are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed methods. Finally, we exploit the convexity of our methods to derive a converse theorem for safety verification using barrier certificates. },

abstract = {We describe a learning-based approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping from monocular images. To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images independent of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. We describe two large-scale experiments that we conducted on two separate robotic platforms. In the first experiment, about 800,000 grasp attempts were collected over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and gripper wear and tear. In the second experiment, we used a different robotic platform and 8 robots to collect a dataset consisting of over 900,000 grasp attempts. The second robotic platform was used to test transfer between robots, and the degree to which data from a different set of robots can be used to aid learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing. Our transfer experiment also illustrates that data from different robots can be combined to learn more reliable and effective grasping.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach for synthesizing and optimizing both positions and forces in force closure grasps. This problem is a non-convex opti-mization problem in general since it involves constraints that are bilinear; in partic-ular, computing wrenches involves a bilinear product between grasp contact points and contact forces. Thus, conventional approaches to this problem typically employ general purpose gradient-based nonlinear optimization. The key observation of this paper is that the force closure grasp synthesis problem can be posed as a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI), for which there exist efficient solution techniques based on semidefinite programming. We show that we can synthesize force closure grasps on different geometric objects, and by maximizing a lower bound of a grasp metric, we can improve the quality of the grasp. While this approach is not guaranteed to find a solution, it has a few distinct advantages. First, we can handle non-smooth but convex positive semidefinite constraints, which can often be important. Second, in contrast to gradient-based approaches we can prove infeasibility of problems. We demonstrate our method on a 15 joint robot model grasping objects with various geometries.

Papadopoulos, Wear, 143 (1991) 307-330). The problems we consider, where the normal force is known a priori, have unique solutions although the friction force (and torque) may be a discontinuous function of the direction of motion. When a freely sliding object comes to rest it always does so with one of several definite ratios of translation to rotation. These special generalized velocity directions, termed eigen-directions, depend on the friction law used, the contact pressure distribution and the mass distribution. The eigen-directions correspond to local extrema of the generalized frictional load |P| on the limit surface, i.e. to directions in load space where P is parallel to the generalized direction of motion q. For most objects, if the contact region is sufficiently smaller than the radius of gyration, final motion is always pure rotation about the center of mass; if the contact region is sufficiently spread out final motion is a pure translation. A simple model of a car with locked rear wheels shows the effect of speed and orientation on skid stability at finite speeds. Sliders have a propensity to rotate about points of support. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = { To plan dynamic, whole-body motions for robots, one conventionally faces the choice between a complex, full-body dynamic model containing every link and actuator of the robot, or a highly simplified model of the robot as a point mass. 
In this paper we explore a powerful middle ground between these extremes. 
We exploit the fact that while the full dynamics of humanoid robots are complicated, their centroidal dynamics (the evolution of the angular momentum and the center of mass (COM) position) are much simpler.
By treating the dynamics of the robot in centroidal form and directly optimizing the joint trajectories for the actuated degrees of freedom, we arrive at a method that enjoys simpler dynamics, while still having the expressiveness required to handle kinematic constraints such as collision avoidance or reaching to a target.
We further require that the robot's COM and angular momentum as computed from the joint trajectories match those given by the centroidal dynamics.
This ensures that the dynamics considered by our optimization are equivalent to the full dynamics of the robot, provided that the robot's actuators can supply sufficient torque.
We demonstrate that this algorithm is capable of generating highly-dynamic motion plans with examples of a humanoid robot negotiating obstacle course elements and gait optimization for a quadrupedal robot.
Additionally, we show that we can plan without pre-specifying the contact sequence by exploiting the complementarity conditions between contact forces and contact distance. },

change of centroidal angular momentum of a robot, as the
physical quantity containing its stability information. We propose
three control strategies using {\&}{\#}729;H G that can be used for stability
recapture of biped robots.
For free walk on horizontal ground, a derived criterion refers
to a point on the foot/ground surface of a robot where the total
ground reaction force would have to act such that {\&}{\#}729;H G = 0. This
new criterion generalizes earlier concepts such as GCoM, CoP,
ZMP, and FRI point, and extends their applicability. },

are becoming increasingly plausible due to recent progress
in perching using $\backslash$91micro-spines$\backslash$92 mounted on tuned suspensions
and, separately, on feedback motion planning techniques for
post-stall maneuvering. In this paper, we bring these complementary
techniques together by efficiently estimating the
mechanical stability of the plane when it makes contact with
a vertical surface; the resulting landing funnel can then be
used in a feedback motion planning algorithm for the flight
controller.
We consider a simplified model of the perching dynamics
and report an extension of the region of attraction techniques,
using sums-of-squares optimization, which combines polynomial
approximations of barrier constraints with the traditional
Lyapunov methods to achieve tight estimation of the true region
of attraction for the model. We demonstrate the new method
on a variety of design parameters for the perching system,
suggesting a potential use as a mechanical system or controller

The forward dynamics of a 27-dof humanoid with 10 contacts are evaluated in 0.1 msec. Since the simulation is stable at 10 msec timesteps, it can run 100 times faster than real-time on a single core of a desktop processor. Furthermore the entire simulation pipeline can be inverted analytically, an order-of-magnitude faster than the corresponding forward dynamics. We soften all constraints, in a way that avoids instabilities and unrealistic penetrations associated with earlier spring-damper methods and yet is sufficient to allow inversion. Constraints are imposed via impulses, using an extended version of the velocity-stepping approach. For holomonic constraints the extension involves a soft version of the Gauss principle. For all other constraints we extend our earlier work on complementarity-free contact dynamics - which were already known to be invertible via an iterative solver - and develop a new formulation allowing analytical inversion.},

abstract = {Contact dynamics are commonly formulated as a linear complementarity problem. While this approach is superior to earlier spring-damper models, it can be inaccurate due to pyramid approximations to the friction cone, and inefficient due to lack of convexity coupled with a large number of auxiliary variables. Here we propose a new approach: implicit complementarity. Instead of treating contact velocities and forces as independent variables subject to explicit complementarity constraints, we express them as functions of a minimal set of unconstrained variables, and design these functions so that the complementarity constraints are automatically satisfied. We then solve the equations of motion via a non-smooth Gauss-Newton method augmented with an original linesearch procedure which exploits the problem structure. This enables us to represent the friction cone exactly and to reduce the number of unknowns by about a factor of 3. Numerical tests suggest that, in usage scenarios typical for robotics, the solver takes only about 5 iterations even without warm starts. More extensive tests and side-by-side comparisons remain to be done, but nevertheless the potential of the new approach is clear.},

Three primary sources of information are exploited: (1) embedded force/torque sensors, (2) embedded inertial sensors, (3) distributed tactile sensors (i.e. artificial skin). In order to cope with external wrenches applied at continuously changing locations, we model the kinematic chain with a graph which dynamically adapts to the contact locations. Classical pre-order and post-order traversals of this dynamically evolving graph allow computing whole-body dynamics and estimate external wrenches.

Zhukovskii's moment function (N. E. Zhukovskii, Collected Works, Vol. 1, Gostekhizdat, Moscow, 1948, pp. 339-354) is the net frictional moment about the body's instantaneous center of rotation as a function of its location. Both of these descriptions implicitly contain the full relation between slip motion and frictional load. While Zhukovskii's moment function applies only to ordinary isotropic Coulomb friction, the limit surface applies to a wider class of friction laws that includes, for example, contact mediated by massless rigid wheels. Both the limit surface and the moment function can be used to deduce results concerning the motion of sliding rigid bodies.},

Many critical tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning of rigid-body systems that contact their environment through inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints. We leverage Sequential Quadratic Programming to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high-dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high-speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

Typical examples are inverse kinematics or dynamics. The objectives can be given as equalities to be satisfied (e.g. point-to-point task) or as areas of satisfaction (e.g. the joint range). This paper proposes a complete solution to solve multiple least-square quadratic problems of both equality and inequality constraints ordered into a strict hierarchy. Our method is able to solve a hierarchy of only equalities 10 times faster than the iterative-projection hierarchical solvers and can consider inequalities at any level while running at the typical control frequency on whole-body size problems. This generic solver is used to resolve the redundancy of humanoid robots while generating complex movements in constrained environments.},

abstract = {The most widely used technique for generating whole-body motions on a humanoid robot accounting for various tasks and constraints is inverse kinematics. Based on the task-function approach, this class of methods enables the coordination of robot movements to execute several tasks in parallel and account for the sensor feedback in real time, thanks to the low computation cost. To some extent, it also enables us to deal with some of the robot constraints (e.g., joint limits or visibility) and manage the quasi-static balance of the robot. In order to fully use the whole range of possible motions, this paper proposes extending the task-function approach to handle the full dynamics of the robot multibody along with any constraint written as equality or inequality of the state and control variables. The definition of multiple objectives is made possible by ordering them inside a strict hierarchy. Several models of contact with the environment can be implemented in the framework. We propose a reduced formulation of the multiple rigid planar contact that keeps a low computation cost. The efficiency of this approach is illustrated by presenting several multicontact dynamic motions in simulation and on the real HRP-2 robot.},

Using a B-spline time parameterization for the active joints, we turn the motion-planning problem into a semi-infinite programming formulation that is solved by nonlinear optimization techniques. Our main contribution lies in producing constraint-satisfaction guaranteed motions for any time grid. Indeed, we use Taylor series expansion to approximate the dynamic and kinematic models over fixed successive time intervals, and transform the problem (constraints and cost functions) into time polynomials which coefficients are function of the optimization variables. The evaluation of the constraints turns then into computation of extrema (over each time interval) that are given to the solver. We also account for collisions and self-collisions constraints that have not a closed-form expression over the time. We address the problem of the balance within the optimization problem and demonstrate that generating whole-body multi-contact dynamic motion for complex tasks is possible and can be tractable, although still time consuming. We discuss thoroughly the planning of a sitting motion with the HRP-2 humanoid robot and assess our method with several other complex scenarios.},

abstract = {Impacts are instantaneous, computationally efficient approximations of collisions. Current impact models sacrifice important physical principles to achieve that efficiency, yielding qualitative and quantitative errors when applied to simultaneous impacts in spatial multibody systems. We present a new impact model that produces behaviour similar to that of a detailed compliant contact model, while retaining the efficiency of an instantaneous method. In our model, time and configuration are fixed, but the impact is resolved into distinct compression and expansion phases, themselves comprising sliding and rolling intervals. A constrained optimization problem is solved for each interval to compute incremental impulses while respecting physical laws and principles of contact mechanics. We present the mathematical model, algorithms for its practical implementation, and examples that demonstrate its effectiveness. In collisions involving materials of various stiffnesses, our model can be more than 20 times faster than integrating through the collision using a compliant contact model. This work extends the use of instantaneous impact models to scientific and engineering applications with strict accuracy requirements, where compliant contact models would otherwise be required. An open-source implementation is available in Simbody, a C++ multibody dynamics library widely used in biomechanical and robotic applications.},

abstract = {Rigid-body dynamics with unilateral contact is a good approximation for a wide range of everyday phenomena, from the operation of car brakes to walking to rock slides. It is also of vital importance for simulating robots, virtual reality, and realistic animation. However, correctly modeling rigid-body dynamics with friction is difficult due to a number of dis- continuities in the behavior of rigid bodies and the discontinuities inherent in the Coulomb friction law. This is particularly crucial for handling situations with large coefficients of friction, which can result in paradoxical results known at least since Painlev´ e[C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 121 (1895), pp. 112–115]. This single example has been a counterexample and cause of controversy ever since, and only recently have there been rigorous mathematical results that show the existence of solutions to his example. The new mathematical developments in rigid-body dynamics have come from several sources: “sweeping processes” and the measure differential inclusions of Moreau in the 1970s and 1980s, the variational inequality approaches of Duvaut and J.-L. Lions in the 1970s, and the use of complementarity problems to formulate frictional contact problems by L¨ otstedt in the early 1980s. However, it wasn't until much more recently that these tools were finally able to produce rigorous results about rigid-body dynamics with Coulomb friction and impulses. Key},

abstract = {Some problems in the dynamics of sliding of planar rigid bodies are treated by geometric methods based on the limit surface description of friction (S. Goyal, A. Ruina and J. Papadopoulos, Wear, 143 (1991) 307-330). The problems we consider, where the normal force is known a priori, have unique solutions although the friction force (and torque) may be a discontinuous function of the direction of motion. When a freely sliding object comes to rest it always does so with one of several definite ratios of translation to rotation. These special generalized velocity directions, termed eigen-directions, depend on the friction law used, the contact pressure distribution and the mass distribution. The eigen-directions correspond to local extrema of the generalized frictional load |P| on the limit surface, i.e. to directions in load space where P is parallel to the generalized direction of motion q. For most objects, if the contact region is sufficiently smaller than the radius of gyration, final motion is always pure rotation about the center of mass; if the contact region is sufficiently spread out final motion is a pure translation. A simple model of a car with locked rear wheels shows the effect of speed and orientation on skid stability at finite speeds. Sliders have a propensity to rotate about points of support. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Autonomous learning of object manipulation skills can enable robots to acquire rich behavioral repertoires that scale to the variety of objects found in the real world. However, current motion skill learning methods typically restrict the behavior to a compact, low-dimensional representation, limiting its expressiveness and generality. In this paper, we extend a recently developed policy search method $\backslash$cite{\{}la-lnnpg-14{\}} and use it to learn a range of dynamic manipulation behaviors with highly general policy representations, without using known models or example demonstrations. Our approach learns a set of trajectories for the desired motion skill by using iteratively refitted time-varying linear models, and then unifies these trajectories into a single control policy that can generalize to new situations. To enable this method to run on a real robot, we introduce several improvements that reduce the sample count and automate parameter selection. We show that our method can acquire fast, fluent behaviors after only minutes of interaction time, and can learn robust controllers for complex tasks, including putting together a toy airplane, stacking tight-fitting lego blocks, placing wooden rings onto tight-fitting pegs, inserting a shoe tree into a shoe, and screwing bottle caps onto bottles.},

First, we present a method which exactly certifies sufficient conditions for invariance despite relying on approximate trajectories from numerical integration. Our second method relaxes the constraints of the first by sampling in time. In applications, this can recover almost identical funnels but is much faster to compute. In both cases, funnels are verified using Sum-of-Squares programming to search over a family of time-varying polynomial Lyapunov functions. Initial candidate Lyapunov functions are constructed using the linearization about the trajectory, and associated time-varying Lyapunov and Riccati differential equations.

abstract = { A methodology for safety verification of continuous and hybrid systems using barrier certificates has been proposed recently. Conditions that must be satisfied by a barrier certificate can be formulated as a convex program, and the feasibility of the program implies system safety in the sense that there is no trajectory starting from a given set of initial states that reaches a given unsafe region. The dual of this problem, i.e., the reachability problem, concerns proving the existence of a trajectory starting from the initial set that reaches another given set. Using insights from the linear programming duality appearing in the discrete shortest path problem, we show in this paper that reachability of continuous systems can also be verified through convex programming. Several convex programs for verifying safety and reachability, as well as other temporal properties such as eventuality, avoidance, and their combinations, are formulated. Some examples are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed methods. Finally, we exploit the convexity of our methods to derive a converse theorem for safety verification using barrier certificates. },

However, some of the most commonly used methods for performing this analysis do not distinguish between active torque generation and passive resistance at the joints (and, in fact, many commonly used methods disregard the actuation mechanism entirely). In this study, we introduce an analysis framework constructed to capture such differences, and present evidence showing that this is an important distinction to make when assessing the stability of a grasp employing some of the most commonly used actuation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Grasping an object is a task that inherently needs to be treated in a hybrid fashion. The system must decide both where and how to grasp the object. While selecting where to grasp requires learning about the object as a whole, the execution only needs to reactively adapt to the context close to the grasp's location. We propose a hierarchical controller that reflects the structure of these two sub-problems, and attempts to learn solutions that work for both. A hybrid architecture is employed by the controller to make use of various machine learning methods that can cope with the large amount of uncertainty inherent to the task. The controller's upper level selects where to grasp the object using a reinforcement learner, while the lower level comprises an imitation learner and a vision-based reactive controller to determine appropriate grasping motions. The resulting system is able to quickly learn good grasps of a novel object in an unstructured environment, by executing smooth reaching motions and preshaping the hand depending on the object's geometry. The system was evaluated both in simulation and on a real robot.},

optimize the robustness of a control system for a robot walking

the terrain enter the equations of motion through a relocation of
the hybrid event guards which trigger an impact event; these
perturbations can have a large effect on the stability of the robot
and do not fit into the traditional robust control analysis and
design methodologies without additional machinery. We attempt
to provide that machinery here. In particular, we quantify the
robustness of the system to terrain perturbations by defining
an L2 gain from terrain perturbations to deviations from the
nominal limit cycle. We show that the solution to a periodic
dissipation inequality provides a sufficient upper bound on
this gain for a linear approximation of the dynamics around
the limit cycle, and we formulate a semidefinite programming
problem to compute the L2 gain for the system with a fixed
linear controller. We then use either binary search or an
iterative optimization method to construct a linear robust
controller and to minimize the L2 gain. The simulation results
on canonical robots suggest that the L2 gain is closely correlated
to the actual number of steps traversed on the rough terrain,
and our controller can improve the robot�s robustness to terrain

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach for synthesizing and optimizing both positions and forces in force closure grasps. This problem is a non-convex opti-mization problem in general since it involves constraints that are bilinear; in partic-ular, computing wrenches involves a bilinear product between grasp contact points and contact forces. Thus, conventional approaches to this problem typically employ general purpose gradient-based nonlinear optimization. The key observation of this paper is that the force closure grasp synthesis problem can be posed as a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI), for which there exist efficient solution techniques based on semidefinite programming. We show that we can synthesize force closure grasps on different geometric objects, and by maximizing a lower bound of a grasp metric, we can improve the quality of the grasp. While this approach is not guaranteed to find a solution, it has a few distinct advantages. First, we can handle non-smooth but convex positive semidefinite constraints, which can often be important. Second, in contrast to gradient-based approaches we can prove infeasibility of problems. We demonstrate our method on a 15 joint robot model grasping objects with various geometries.

abstract = {This paper investigates real-time control strategies for dynamical systems that involve frictional contact interactions. Hybridness and underactuation are key characteristics of these systems that complicate the design of feedback controllers. In this research, we examine and test a novel feedback controller design on a planar pushing system, where the purpose is to control the motion of a sliding object on a flat surface using a point robotic pusher. The pusher-slider is a simple dynamical system that retains many of the challenges that are typical of robotic manipulation tasks. Our results show that a model predictive control approach used in tandem with integer programming offers a powerful solution to capture the dynamic constraints associated with the friction cone as well as the hybrid nature of the contact. In order to achieve real-time control, simplifications are proposed to speed up the integer program. The concept of Family of Modes (FOM) is introduced to solve an online convex optimization problem by selecting a set of contact mode schedules that spans a large set of dynamic behaviors that can occur during the prediction horizon. The controller design is applied to stabilize the motion of a sliding object about a nominal trajectory, and to re-plan its trajectory in real-time to follow a moving target. We validate the controller design through numerical simulations and experimental results on an industrial ABB IRB 120 robotic arm.},

abstract = {Control of grasp stability under different frictional conditions has primarily been studied in manipulatory tasks involving two digits only. Recently we found that many of the principles for control of forces originally demonstrated for two-digit grasping also apply to various three-digit grasps. Here we examine the control of grasp stability in a multidigit task in which subjects used the tips of the thumb, index, and middle finger to lift an object. The grasp resembled those used when lifting a cylindrical object from above. The digits either all contacted the same surface material or one of the digits contacted a surface material that was more, or less, slippery than that contacted by the other two digits. The three-dimensional forces and torques applied by each digit and the contact positions were measured along with the position and orientation of the object. The distribution of forces among the digits strongly reflected constraints imposed by the geometric relationship between the object's center of mass and the contact surfaces. On top of this distribution, we observed changes in force coordination related to changes in the combination of surface materials. When all digits contacted the same surface material, the ratio between the normal force and tangential load (F(n):L ratio) was similar across digits and scaled to provide an adequate safety margin against slip. With different contact surfaces subjects adapted the F(n):L ratios at the individual digits to the local friction with only small influences by the friction at the other two digits. They accomplished this by scaling the normal forces similarly at all digits and changing the distribution of load among the digits. The surface combination did not, however, influence digit position, tangential torque, or object tilting systematically. The change in load distribution, rather, resulted from interplay between these factors, and the nature of this interplay varied between trials. That is, subjects achieved grasp stability with various combinations of fingertip actions and appeared to exploit the many degrees of freedom offered by the multidigit grasp. The results extend previous findings based on two-digit tasks to multidigit tasks by showing that subjects adjust fingertip forces at each digit to the local friction. Moreover, our findings suggest that subjects adapted the load distribution to the current frictional condition by regulating the normal forces to allow slips to occur early in the lift task, prior to object lift-off.},

Using a B-spline time parameterization for the active joints, we turn the motion-planning problem into a semi-infinite programming formulation that is solved by nonlinear optimization techniques. Our main contribution lies in producing constraint-satisfaction guaranteed motions for any time grid. Indeed, we use Taylor series expansion to approximate the dynamic and kinematic models over fixed successive time intervals, and transform the problem (constraints and cost functions) into time polynomials which coefficients are function of the optimization variables. The evaluation of the constraints turns then into computation of extrema (over each time interval) that are given to the solver. We also account for collisions and self-collisions constraints that have not a closed-form expression over the time. We address the problem of the balance within the optimization problem and demonstrate that generating whole-body multi-contact dynamic motion for complex tasks is possible and can be tractable, although still time consuming. We discuss thoroughly the planning of a sitting motion with the HRP-2 humanoid robot and assess our method with several other complex scenarios.},

abstract = { Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally
optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion
and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environ-
ment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result
from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a
specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for
trajectory planning of rigid body systems that contact their environment through
inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement
for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dy-
namics as a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) for forward simulation, the
proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program
with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). We leverage Sequential Quadratic
Programming (SQP) to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simul-
taneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints.
The method scales well to high dimensional systems with large numbers of possi-
ble modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems:
rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar
walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high speed bipedal running on the
FastRunner platform. },

abstract = { Recent trends pushing robots into unstructured environments with limited sensors have motivated considerable work on planning under uncertainty and stochastic optimal control, but these methods typically do not provide guaranteed performance. Here we consider the problem of bounding the probability of failure (defined as leaving a finite region of state space) over a finite time for stochastic non-linear systems with continuous state. Our approach searches for exponential barrier functions that provide bounds using a variant of the classical supermartingale result. We provide a relaxation of this search to a semidefinite program, yielding an efficient algorithm that provides rigorous upper bounds on the probability of failure for the original non-linear system. We give a number of numerical examples in both discrete and continuous time that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. },

abstract = {The form-closure and force-closure properties of robotic grasp ing are investigated. Loosely speaking, these properties are related to the capability of the robot to inhibit motions of the workpiece in spite of externally applied forces. In this article, form-closure is considered as a purely geometric property of a set of unilateral (contact) constraints, such as those applied on a workpiece by a mechanical fixture, while force-closure is related to the capability of the particular robotic device being considered to apply forces through contacts. The concepts of partial form- and force-closure properties are introduced and discussed, and an algorithm is proposed to obtain a synthetic geometric description of partial form-closure constraints. Al though the literature abounds with form-closure tests, proposed algorithms for testing force-closure are either approximate or computationally expensive. This article proves the equiva lence of force-closure analysis with the study of the equilibria of an ordinary...},

abstract = {ABSTRACTIn this paper, we propose a fast optimisation algorithm for approximately minimising convex quadratic functions over the intersection of affine and separable constraints (i.e. the Cartesian product of possibly nonconvex real sets). This problem class contains many NP-hard problems such as mixed-integer quadratic programming. Our heuristic is based on a variation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), an algorithm for solving convex optimisation problems. We discuss the favourable computational aspects of our algorithm, which allow it to run quickly even on very modest computational platforms such as embedded processors. We give several examples for which an approximate solution should be found very quickly, such as management of a hybrid-electric vehicle drivetrain and control of switched-mode power converters. Our numerical experiments suggest that our method is very effective in finding a feasible point with small objective value; indeed, we see that in many cases, it finds t...},

The limit surface, from classical plasticity theory, is the surface in load space which bounds the set of all possible frictional forces and moments that can be sustained by the frictional interface. Zhukovskii's moment function (N. E. Zhukovskii, Collected Works, Vol. 1, Gostekhizdat, Moscow, 1948, pp. 339-354) is the net frictional moment about the body's instantaneous center of rotation as a function of its location. Both of these descriptions implicitly contain the full relation between slip motion and frictional load. While Zhukovskii's moment function applies only to ordinary isotropic Coulomb friction, the limit surface applies to a wider class of friction laws that includes, for example, contact mediated by massless rigid wheels. Both the limit surface and the moment function can be used to deduce results concerning the motion of sliding rigid bodies.},

Properties of the Poincar{\'{e}} map and its first- and second-order derivatives are used to translate the problem of exponential stabilization of the periodic orbit into a set of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). A BMI optimization problem is then set up to tune the parameters of the continuous-time controller so that the Jacobian of the Poincar{\'{e}} map has its eigenvalues in the unit circle. It is also shown how robustness against uncertainty in the switching condition of the hybrid system can be incorporated into the design problem.

In this paper we further extend the class of systems that can be analyzed with convexity-based methods. We show how to analyze the robust stability properties of uncertain nonlinear systems with polynomial or rational dynamics, via contraction analysis and SOS programming. Since the existence of a global contraction metric is a sufficient condition for global stability of an autonomous system, we develop an algorithm for finding such contraction metrics using SOS programming. The search process is made computationally tractable by relaxing matrix definiteness constraints, the feasibility of which indicates the existence of a contraction metric, to SOS constraints on polynomial matrices.

abstract = {This two-part paper discusses the analysis and control of legged locomotion in terms of N-step capturability: the ability of a legged system to come to a stop without falling by taking N or fewer steps. We consider this ability to be crucial to legged locomotion and a useful, yet not overly restrictive criterion for stability. Part 1 introduced the N-step capturability framework and showed how to obtain capture regions and control sequences for simplified gait models. In Part 2, we describe an algorithm that uses these results as approximations to control a humanoid robot. The main contributions of this part are (1) step location adjustment using the 1-step capture region, (2) novel instantaneous capture point control strategies, and 3) an experimental evaluation of the 1-step capturability margin. The presented algorithm was tested using M2V2, a 3D force-controlled bipedal robot with 12 actuated degrees of freedom in the legs, both in simulation and in physical experiments. The physical robot was able to...},

abstract = {In the absence of vision, grasping an object often relies on tactile$\backslash$nfeedback from the fingertips. As the finger pushes the object, the$\backslash$nfingertip can feel the contact point move. If the object is known in$\backslash$nadvance, from this motion the finger may infer the location of the$\backslash$ncontact point on the object, and thereby the object pose. This paper$\backslash$nprimarily investigates the problem of determining the pose (orientation$\backslash$nand position) and motion (velocity and angular velocity) of a planar$\backslash$nobject with known geometry from such contact motion generated by$\backslash$npushing.$\backslash$nA dynamic analysis of pushing yields a nonlinear system that relates$\backslash$nthrough contact the object pose and motion to the finger motion. The$\backslash$ncontact motion on the fingertip, thus encodes certain information about$\backslash$nthe object pose. Nonlinear observability theory is employed to show that$\backslash$nsuch information is sufficient for the finger to ``observe{\{}''{\}} not only$\backslash$nthe pose, but also the motion of the object. Therefore, a sensing$\backslash$nstrategy can be realized as an ``observer{\{}''{\}} of the nonlinear dynamical$\backslash$nsystem. Two observers are subsequently introduced. The first observer;$\backslash$nbased on the work of Gauthier, Hammouri, and Othman (1992), has its$\backslash$n``gain{\{}''{\}} determined by the solution of a Lyapunov-like equation; it$\backslash$ncan be activated at any time instant during a push. The second observes$\backslash$nbased on Newton's method, solves for the initial (motionless) object$\backslash$npose from three intermediate contact points during a push.$\backslash$nUnder the Coulomb-friction model, the paper deals with support friction$\backslash$nin the plane and/or contact friction between the finger and the object.$\backslash$nExtensive simulations have been done to demonstrate the feasibility of$\backslash$nthe two observers.

abstract = {Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning of rigid-body systems that contact their environment through inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints. We leverage Sequential Quadratic Programming to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high-dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high-speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

Analytical rigid-body contact models are used extensively in planning and control due to their computa-tional efficiency and simplicity, yet despite their prevalence, little if any empirical comparison of these models has been made and it is unclear how well they approx-imate contact outcomes. In this paper, we first formulate a system identification approach for six commonly used contact models in the literature, and use the pro-posed method to find parameters for an experimental data-set of impacts. Next, we compare the models empirically, and establish a task specific upper bound on the performance of the models and the rigid-body contact model paradigm.

@article{Dai14,
abstract = { To plan dynamic, whole-body motions for robots, one conventionally faces the choice between a complex, full-body dynamic model containing every link and actuator of the robot, or a highly simplified model of the robot as a point mass. 
In this paper we explore a powerful middle ground between these extremes. 
We exploit the fact that while the full dynamics of humanoid robots are complicated, their centroidal dynamics (the evolution of the angular momentum and the center of mass (COM) position) are much simpler.
By treating the dynamics of the robot in centroidal form and directly optimizing the joint trajectories for the actuated degrees of freedom, we arrive at a method that enjoys simpler dynamics, while still having the expressiveness required to handle kinematic constraints such as collision avoidance or reaching to a target.
We further require that the robot's COM and angular momentum as computed from the joint trajectories match those given by the centroidal dynamics.
This ensures that the dynamics considered by our optimization are equivalent to the full dynamics of the robot, provided that the robot's actuators can supply sufficient torque.
We demonstrate that this algorithm is capable of generating highly-dynamic motion plans with examples of a humanoid robot negotiating obstacle course elements and gait optimization for a quadrupedal robot.
Additionally, we show that we can plan without pre-specifying the contact sequence by exploiting the complementarity conditions between contact forces and contact distance. },

abstract = {One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, these dynamics are described by physics-based analytical models, which may however be very hard to find for complex problems. More recently, we have seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of more complex physical interactions directly from sensory input. However, it is an open question how far these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we analyse how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of both worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which there exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We propose to use a neural network to convert the raw sensory data into a suitable representation that can be consumed by the analytical model and compare this approach to using neural networks for both, perception and prediction. Our results show that the combined method outperforms the purely learned version in terms of accuracy and generalization to push actions not seen during training. It also performs comparable to the analytical model applied on ground truth input values, despite using raw sensory data as input.},

We focus primarily on the tripod grasp, which is the most commonly used grasp for precision manipulation. We systematically explore the space of design parameters, with two main objectives: maximize the workspace of a fully actuated hand and explore how under-actuation modifies it. We use a mathematical framework that models the hand-plus-object system and examine how the workspace varies with changes in nine hand and object parameters such as link length and finger arrangement on the palm. Results show that to achieve the largest workspaces the palm radius should be approximately half of a finger length larger than the target object radius, that the distal link of the two-link fingers should be around 1–1.2 times the length of the proximal link, and that fingers should be arranged symmetrically about the palm with object contacts also symmetric. Furthermore, a proper parameter design for an under-actuated hand can achieve up to 50{\%} of the workspace of a fully actuated hand. When compared to the system parameters of existing popular hand designs, larger palms and longer distal links are needed to maximize the manipulation workspace of the studied design.},

abstract = {Contact dynamics are commonly formulated as a linear complementarity problem. While this approach is superior to earlier spring-damper models, it can be inaccurate due to pyramid approximations to the friction cone, and inefficient due to lack of convexity coupled with a large number of auxiliary variables. Here we propose a new approach: implicit complementarity. Instead of treating contact velocities and forces as independent variables subject to explicit complementarity constraints, we express them as functions of a minimal set of unconstrained variables, and design these functions so that the complementarity constraints are automatically satisfied. We then solve the equations of motion via a non-smooth Gauss-Newton method augmented with an original linesearch procedure which exploits the problem structure. This enables us to represent the friction cone exactly and to reduce the number of unknowns by about a factor of 3. Numerical tests suggest that, in usage scenarios typical for robotics, the solver takes only about 5 iterations even without warm starts. More extensive tests and side-by-side comparisons remain to be done, but nevertheless the potential of the new approach is clear.},

@phdthesis{Pratt00,
abstract = { Walking is an easy task for most humans and animals. Two characteristics which make it easy are the inherent robustness (tolerance to variation) of the walking problem and the natural dynamics of the walking mechanism. In this thesis we show how understanding and exploiting these two characteristics can aid in the control of bipedal robots. Inherent robustness allows for the use of simple, low impedance controllers. Natural dynamics reduces the requirements of the controller. We present a series of simple physical models of bipedal walking. The insight gained from these models is used in the development of three planar (motion only in the sagittal plane) control algorithms. The first uses simple strategies to control the robot to walk. The second exploits the natural dynamics of a kneecap, compliant ankle, and passive swing-leg. The third achieves fast swing of the swing-leg in order to enable the robot to walk quickly (1.25 m/s). These algorithms are implemented on Spring Flamingo, a planar bipedal walking robot, which was designed and built for this thesis. Using these algorithms, the robot can stand and balance, start and stop walking, walk at a range of speeds, and traverse slopes and rolling terrain. Three-dimensional walking on at ground is implemented and tested in simulation. The dynamics of the sagittal plane are sufficiently decoupled from the dynamics of the frontal and transverse planes such that control of each can be treated separately. We achieve three-dimensional walking by adding lateral balance to the planar algorithms. Tests of this approach on a real three-dimensional robot will lead to a more complete understanding of the control of bipedal walking in robots and humans. },

abstract = { The construction of feedback control laws for underactuated nonlinear robotic systems with
input saturation limits is crucial for dynamic robotic tasks such as walking, running, or flying.
Existing techniques for feedback control design are either restricted to linear systems, rely on
discretizations of the state space, or require solving a non-convex optimization problem that
requires feasible initialization. This paper presents a method for designing feedback controllers for polynomial systems that maximize the size of the time�limited backwards reachable set (BRS). In contrast to traditional approaches based on Lyapunov�s criteria for stability, we
rely on the notion of occupation measures to pose this problem as an infinite�dimensional linear program which can then be approximated in finite dimension via semidefinite programs (SDP)s. The solution to each SDP yields a polynomial control policy and an outer approximation of the largest achievable BRS which is well-suited for use in a trajectory library or feedback motion planning algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on six nonlinear systems. Comparisons to an infinite�horizon linear quadratic regulator approach and
an approach relying on Lyapunov�s criteria for stability are also included in order to illustrate
the improved performance of the presented technique.

abstract = {We describe a learning-based approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping from monocular images. To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images independent of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. We describe two large-scale experiments that we conducted on two separate robotic platforms. In the first experiment, about 800,000 grasp attempts were collected over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and gripper wear and tear. In the second experiment, we used a different robotic platform and 8 robots to collect a dataset consisting of over 900,000 grasp attempts. The second robotic platform was used to test transfer between robots, and the degree to which data from a different set of robots can be used to aid learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing. Our transfer experiment also illustrates that data from different robots can be combined to learn more reliable and effective grasping.},

abstract = { Maintaining balance is fundamental to legged robots. The most commonly used mechanisms for balance control are taking a step, regulating the center of pressure (ankle strategies), and to a lesser extent, changing centroidal angular momentum (e.g., hip strategies). In this paper, we disregard these three mechanisms, instead focusing on a fourth: varying center of mass height. We study a 2D variable-height center of mass model, and analyze how center of mass height variation can be used to achieve balance, in the sense of convergence to a fixed point of the dynamics. In this analysis, we pay special attention to the constraint of unilateral contact forces. We first derive a necessary condition that must be satisfied to be able to achieve balance. We then present two control laws, and derive their regions of attraction in closed form. We show that one of the control laws achieves balance from any state satisfying the necessary condition for balance. Finally, we briefly discuss the relative importance of CoM height variation and other balance mechanisms. },

abstract = {We describe a full-featured simulation pipeline implemented in the MuJoCo physics engine. It includes multi-joint dynamics in generalized coordinates, holonomic constraints, dry joint friction, joint and tendon limits, frictionless and frictional contacts that can have sliding, torsional and rolling friction. The forward dynamics of a 27-dof humanoid with 10 contacts are evaluated in 0.1 msec. Since the simulation is stable at 10 msec timesteps, it can run 100 times faster than real-time on a single core of a desktop processor. Furthermore the entire simulation pipeline can be inverted analytically, an order-of-magnitude faster than the corresponding forward dynamics. We soften all constraints, in a way that avoids instabilities and unrealistic penetrations associated with earlier spring-damper methods and yet is sufficient to allow inversion. Constraints are imposed via impulses, using an extended version of the velocity-stepping approach. For holomonic constraints the extension involves a soft version of the Gauss principle. For all other constraints we extend our earlier work on complementarity-free contact dynamics - which were already known to be invertible via an iterative solver - and develop a new formulation allowing analytical inversion.},

bounding is highly dynamic and cannot be planned with quasi-steady approximations. LittleDog is modeled as a planar

space that respects the kinodynamic constraints due to underactuation and motor limits is extremely challenging. Rapidly
Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are known for fast kinematic path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces in
the presence of obstacles, but search efficiency degrades rapidly with the addition of challenging dynamics. A computationally
tractable planner for bounding was developed by modifying the RRT algorithm by using: (1) motion primitives to
reduce the dimensionality of the problem; (2) Reachability Guidance, which dynamically changes the sampling distribution
and distance metric to address differential constraints and discontinuous motion primitive dynamics; and (3) sampling
with a Voronoi bias in a lower-dimensional �task space� for bounding. Short trajectories were demonstrated to work on
the robot, however open-loop bounding is inherently unstable. A feedback controller based on transverse linearization was
implemented, and shown in simulation to stabilize perturbations in the presence of noise and time delays. },

abstract = {The most widely used technique for generating whole-body motions on a humanoid robot accounting for various tasks and constraints is inverse kinematics. Based on the task-function approach, this class of methods enables the coordination of robot movements to execute several tasks in parallel and account for the sensor feedback in real time, thanks to the low computation cost. To some extent, it also enables us to deal with some of the robot constraints (e.g., joint limits or visibility) and manage the quasi-static balance of the robot. In order to fully use the whole range of possible motions, this paper proposes extending the task-function approach to handle the full dynamics of the robot multibody along with any constraint written as equality or inequality of the state and control variables. The definition of multiple objectives is made possible by ordering them inside a strict hierarchy. Several models of contact with the environment can be implemented in the framework. We propose a reduced formulation of the multiple rigid planar contact that keeps a low computation cost. The efficiency of this approach is illustrated by presenting several multicontact dynamic motions in simulation and on the real HRP-2 robot.},

abstract = {Recently, a number of grasp detection methods have been proposed that can be used to localize robotic grasp configurations directly from sensor data without estimating object pose. The underlying idea is to treat grasp perception analogously to object detection in computer vision. These methods take as input a noisy and partially occluded RGBD image or point cloud and produce as output pose estimates of viable grasps, without assuming a known CAD model of the object. Although these methods generalize grasp knowledge to new objects well, they have not yet been demonstrated to be reliable enough for wide use. Many grasp detection methods achieve grasp success rates (grasp successes as a fraction of the total number of grasp attempts) between 75{\%} and 95{\%} for novel objects presented in isolation or in light clutter. Not only are these success rates too low for practical grasping applications, but the light clutter scenarios that are evaluated often do not reflect the realities of real world grasping. This paper proposes a number of innovations that together result in a significant improvement in grasp detection performance. The specific improvement in performance due to each of our contributions is quantitatively measured either in simulation or on robotic hardware. Ultimately, we report a series of robotic experiments that average a 93{\%} end-to-end grasp success rate for novel objects presented in dense clutter.},

abstract = { Existing high-dimensional motion planning algorithms are simultaneously overpowered and underpowered. In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate “narrow passages” can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique converges over a wider range of input paths and is able to optimize higher-order dynamics of trajectories than previous path optimization strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot. },

abstract = { Legged robots that operate in the real world are inherently subject to stochasticity in their dynamics and uncertainty about the terrain. Owing to limited energy budgets and limited control authority, these disturbances cannot always be canceled out with high-gain feedback. Minimally actuated walking machines subject to stochastic disturbances no longer satisfy strict conditions for limit-cycle stability; however, they can still demonstrate impressively long-living periods of continuous walking. Here, we employ tools from stochastic processes to examine the stochastic stability of idealized rimless-wheel and compass-gait walking on randomly generated uneven terrain. Furthermore, we employ tools from numerical stochastic optimal control to design a controller for an actuated compass gait model which maximizes a measure of stochastic stability - the mean first-passage time - and compare its performance with a deterministic counterpart. Our results demonstrate that walking is well characterized as a metastable process, and that the stochastic dynamics of walking should be accounted for during control design in order to improve the stability of our machines. },

We consider this ability to be crucial to legged locomotion and a useful, yet not overly restrictive criterion for stability. In this part (Part 1), we introduce a theoretical framework for assessing N-step capturability. This framework is used to analyze three simple models of legged locomotion. All three models are based on the 3D Linear Inverted Pendulum Model. The first model relies solely on a point foot step location to maintain balance, the second model adds a finite-sized foot, and the third model enables the use of centroidal angular momentum by adding a reaction mass. We analyze how these mechanisms influence N-step capturability, for any N {\textgreater} 0. Part 2 will show that these results can be used to control a humanoid robot. },

Papadopoulos, Wear, 143 (1991) 307-330). The problems we consider, where the normal force is known a priori, have unique solutions although the friction force (and torque) may be a discontinuous function of the direction of motion. When a freely sliding object comes to rest it always does so with one of several definite ratios of translation to rotation. These special generalized velocity directions, termed eigen-directions, depend on the friction law used, the contact pressure distribution and the mass distribution. The eigen-directions correspond to local extrema of the generalized frictional load |P| on the limit surface, i.e. to directions in load space where P is parallel to the generalized direction of motion q. For most objects, if the contact region is sufficiently smaller than the radius of gyration, final motion is always pure rotation about the center of mass; if the contact region is sufficiently spread out final motion is a pure translation. A simple model of a car with locked rear wheels shows the effect of speed and orientation on skid stability at finite speeds. Sliders have a propensity to rotate about points of support. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

combination of synunetric matrices is positive semidefinite. Such a constraint is nonlinear and nonsmooth, but convex,

problems (e.g., linear and quadratic programming) and finds many applications in engineering and combinatorial

Although semidefinite programs are much more general than linear programs, they are not much harder to solve.
Most interior-point methods for linear programming have been generalized to semidefinite programs. As in linear
programming, these methods have polynomial worst-case complexity and perform very well in practice.
This paper gives a survey of the theory and applications of semidefinite programs and an introduction to primaldual

An efficient dynamics formulation for stable prehensile pushing allows us to plan in-hand manipulations 100-1000 times faster than our previous work which builds upon a complementarity formulation.

One difficulty is that the fundamental principles of natural human running motions are not yet fully understood. The purpose of this paper is to show that mathematical optimization is a helpful tool to gain this insight into fast and complex motions. We present physics-based running motions for complex models of human-like running in three dimensions that have been generated by optimization. Running is modeled as a multiphase periodic motion with discontinuities, based on multibody system models of the locomotor system with actuators and spring-damper elements at each joint. The problem of generating gaits is formulated as offline optimal control problem and solved by an efficient direct multiple shooting method. We present optimization results using energy-related criteria and show that they have a close resemblance to running motions of humans. The results provide information about the internal forces and torques required to produce natural human running, as well as on the resulting kinematics. },

By applying constraint control to the robot body so that it moves on a particular straight line and rotates at a constant angular velocity, the dynamics of the center of mass of the body becomes completely linear. Such motion of the ideal model is called the linear inverted pendulum mode, and it is used to develop the control scheme of the biped walking on rugged terrain. Under the control method in the linear inverted pendulum mode, walking on a particular rugged ground is shown to be equivalent to walking on a level ground. It is also shown that the additional use of the ankle torque makes the proposed control scheme robust and applicable to a real biped robot with mass legs. Simulation results are presented. },

abstract = { Although people's legs are capable of a broad
range of muscle-use and gait patterns, they generally
prefer just two. They walk, swinging their body
over a relatively straight leg with each step, or run,
bouncing up off a bent leg between aerial phases.
Walking feels easiest when going slowly, and running
feels easiest when going faster. More unusual
gaits seemmore tiring. Perhaps this is because walking
and running use the least energy [1; 2; 3; 4; 5;
6; 7]. Addressing this classic [1] conjecture with experiments
[2; 3] requires comparing walking and
running with many other strange and unpracticed
gaits. As an alternative, a basic understanding of
gait choice might be obtained by calculating energy
cost by using mechanics-based models. Here
we use a minimal model that can describe walking
and running as well as an infinite variety of other
gaits. We use computer optimization to find which
gaits are indeed energetically optimal for thismodel.
At low speeds the optimization discovers the classic
inverted-pendulum walk [8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13], at
high speeds it discovers a bouncing run [12; 14]1,
even without springs, and at intermediate speeds
it finds a new pendular-running gait that includes
walking and running as extreme cases. },

abstract = { The control of complex non-linear systems can be aided by modeling each system as a collection of simplified hybrid modes, with each mode representing a particular operating regime defined by the system dynamics or by a region of the state space in which the system operates. Guarantees on the safety and performance of such hybrid systems can still be challenging to generate, however. Reachability analysis using a dynamic game formulation with Hamilton$\backslash$96Jacobi methods provides a useful way to generate these types of guarantees, and the technique is flexible enough to analyze a wide variety of systems. This paper presents two applications of reachable sets, both focused on guaranteeing the safety and performance of robotic aerial vehicles. In the first example, reachable sets are used to design and implement a backflip maneuver for a quadrotor helicopter. In the second, reachability analysis is used to design a decentralized collision avoidance algorithm for multiple quadrotors. The theory for both examples is explained, and successful experimental results are presented from flight tests on the STARMAC quadrotor helicopter platform.

together with our proposed polynomial controllers, can be
efficiently obtained via semidefinite optimization. Our approach
can handle time-varying dynamics resulting from tracking a
given trajectory, input saturations (e.g. torque limits), and can
be extended to deal with uncertainty in the dynamics and state.
The resulting controllers can be used by space-filling feedback
motion planning algorithms to fill up the space with significantly
fewer trajectories. We demonstrate our approach on a severely
torque limited underactuated double pendulum (Acrobot) and
provide extensive simulation and hardware validation. },

The plans assume encoder feedback that gives a geometric partition of the post-grasp configuration space based on contact conditions. An offline planning tree is generated by interleaving com-putationally tractable open-loop action sequence search and feedback state estimation with particle filtering. To speed up planning, we use learned approximate forward motion models, sensor models, and collision detectors.

abstract = { Bipedal robots are difficult to analyze mathematically. However, successful control strategies can be discovered using simple physical intuition and can be described in simple terms. Five things have to happen for a planar bipedal robot to walk. Height has to be stabilized. Pitch has to be stabilized. Speed has to be stabilized. The swing leg has to move so that the feet are in locations which allow for the stability of height, pitch, and speed. Finally, transitions from support leg to support leg must occur at appropriate times. If these ve objectives are achieved, the robot will walk. A number of different intuitive control strategies can be used to achieve each of these five objectives. Further, each strategy can be implemented in a variety of ways. We present several strategies for each objective which we have implemented onabipedal walking robot. Using these simple intuitive strategies, we have compelled a seven link planar bipedal robot, called Spring Flamingo, to walk. The robot walks both slowly and quickly, walks over moderate obstacles, starts, and stops. Video, photographs, and more information on Spring Flamingo can be found at http://www.leglab.ai.mit.edu/ },

The controller that models the person's behavior is given the position of the end of the sleeve and information about contact between the person's hand and the fabric of the gown. We simulate this system with a human torso model that has realistic joint ranges, a simple robot gripper, and a physics-based cloth model for the gown. Through reinforcement learning (specifically the TRPO algorithm) the system creates a model of human behavior that is capable of placing the arm into the sleeve. We aim to model what humans are capable of doing, rather than what they typically do. We demonstrate successfully trained human behaviors for three robot-assisted dressing strategies: 1) the robot gripper holds the sleeve motionless, 2) the gripper moves the sleeve linearly towards the person from the front, and 3) the gripper moves the sleeve linearly from the side.},

The . Summary We have developed a finger - shaped sensor array (BioTAC™) that provides simultaneous information about the contact forces , microvibrations and thermal fluxes induced by contact with external objects . For tasks such as identifying objects or maintaining stable grasp , these sensory modalities tend to be synergistic . For example , information about texture and slip can be derived from vibrations of skin ridges sliding over a surface , but only if the forces on the skin are known and well - controlled . Similarly , information about the material composition of an object can be inferred from the rate of heat transfer from a heated finger to the object , but only if the location and force of contact are similarly well - controlled . The BioTAC sensor is intrinsically simple , robust , and easy to manufacture and repair . The skin possesses texture and tackiness similar to the properties of human skin that facilitate grip and can be easily replaced if worn or damaged . The curved , deformable nature of biological finger tips provides mechanical features that are important for the manipulation of the wide variety of objects encountered naturally . Here we present new data on the thermal characterization of objects using temperature derivative data and show that Gaussian Mixture Model regression can be used to extract contact location and three dimensional force vectors from a moderate number of nonlinear data channels . We close by showing how this force data is needed to calibrate for slip dectection across various textured surfaces with varying force .},

To overcome this difficulty, we formulate the search for the optimal mode sequences offline, separately from the search for optimal control inputs online.

While the potential energetic benefits of springs are well documented in the literature, feedback control designs that effectively realize this potential are lacking. In this paper, we extend and apply the methods of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics, originally developed for rigid robots with a single degree of underactuation, to MABEL, a bipedal walker with a novel compliant transmission and multiple degrees of underactuation. A time-invariant feedback controller is designed such that the closed-loop system respects the natural compliance of the open-loop system and realizes exponentially stable walking gaits. Five experiments are presented that highlight different aspects of MABEL and the feedback design method, ranging from basic elements such as stable walking and robustness under perturbations, to energy efficiency and a bipedal robot walking speed record of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph). The experiments also compare two feedback implementations of the virtual constraints, one based on PD control as on RABBIT, and a second that implements the full hybrid zero dynamics controller. On MABEL, the full hybrid zero dynamics controller yields a much more faithful realization of the desired virtual constraints and was instrumental in achieving more rapid walking. },

uncertainty in the geometry of the terrain. We propose a direct
collocation method which solves simultaneously for a nominal
periodic control input, for many possible one-step solution
trajectories (using ground profiles drawn from a distribution
over terrain), and for the periodic solution to a jump Riccati
equation which provides an expected infinite-horizon cost-to-go
for each of these samples. We demonstrate that this trajectory
optimization scheme can recover the known deadbeat open-
loop control solution for the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum
(SLIP) on unknown terrain. Moreover, we demonstrate that it
generalizes to other models like the bipedal compass gait walker,
resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of steps taken
over moderate terrain when compared against a limit cycle
optimized for efficiency only.

abstract = { Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally optimal trajectories of robotic systems.
Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics of contact as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes.
Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning through contact that eliminates the requirement for an $\backslash$emph{\{}a priori{\}} mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm leverages Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory and satisfying nonlinear complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes.
We demonstrate the approach using three increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot,
and high speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform. },

abstract = {Impacts are instantaneous, computationally efficient approximations of collisions. Current impact models sacrifice important physical principles to achieve that efficiency, yielding qualitative and quantitative errors when applied to simultaneous impacts in spatial multibody systems. We present a new impact model that produces behaviour similar to that of a detailed compliant contact model, while retaining the efficiency of an instantaneous method. In our model, time and configuration are fixed, but the impact is resolved into distinct compression and expansion phases, themselves comprising sliding and rolling intervals. A constrained optimization problem is solved for each interval to compute incremental impulses while respecting physical laws and principles of contact mechanics. We present the mathematical model, algorithms for its practical implementation, and examples that demonstrate its effectiveness. In collisions involving materials of various stiffnesses, our model can be more than 20 times faster than integrating through the collision using a compliant contact model. This work extends the use of instantaneous impact models to scientific and engineering applications with strict accuracy requirements, where compliant contact models would otherwise be required. An open-source implementation is available in Simbody, a C++ multibody dynamics library widely used in biomechanical and robotic applications.},

abstract = { In this paper, we consider linear programming
(LP) and second order cone programming (SOCP) based
alternatives to sum of squares (SOS) programming and apply
this framework to high-dimensional problems arising in control
applications. Despite the wide acceptance of SOS programming
in the control and optimization communities, scalability has
been a key challenge due to its reliance on semidefinite
programming (SDP) as its main computational engine. While
SDPs have many appealing features, current SDP solvers do
not approach the scalability or numerical maturity of LP and
SOCP solvers. Our approach is based on the recent work
of Ahmadi and Majumdar [1], which replaces the positive
semidefiniteness constraint inherent in the SOS approach with
stronger conditions based on
diagonal dominance
and
scaled
diagonal dominance
. This leads to the
DSOS
and
SDSOS
cones
of polynomials, which can be optimized over using LP and
SOCP respectively. We demonstrate this approach on four high
dimensional control problems that are currently well beyond the
reach of SOS programming: computing a region of attraction
for a
22
dimensional system, analysis of a
50
node network
of oscillators, searching for degree
3
controllers and degree
8
Lyapunov functions for an Acrobot system (with the resulting
controller validated on a hardware platform), and a balancing
controller for a
30

ATLAS humanoid robot. While there is additional conservatism
introduced by our approach, extensive numerical experiments
on smaller instances of our problems demonstrate that this
conservatism can be small compared to SOS programming. },

@phdthesis{Parrilo00,
abstract = { In the rst part of this thesis, we introduce a specic class of Linear Matrix Inequalities
(LMI) whose optimal solution can be characterized exactly. This family
corresponds to the case where the associated linear operator maps the cone of positive
semidenite matrices onto itself. In this case, the optimal value equals the
spectral radius of the operator. It is shown that some rank minimization problems,
as well as generalizations of the structured singular value (mu) LMIs, have exactly
this property.
In the same spirit of exploiting structure to achieve computational efficiency,
an algorithm for the numerical solution of a special class of frequency-dependent
LMIs is presented. These optimization problems arise from robustness analysis
questions, via the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma. The procedure is an outer
approximation method based on the algorithms used in the computation of H1
norms for linear, time invariant systems. The result is especially useful for systems
with large state dimension.
The other main contribution in this thesis is the formulation of a convex optimization
framework for semialgebraic problems, i.e., those that can be expressed by
polynomial equalities and inequalities. The key element is the interaction of concepts
in real algebraic geometry (Positivstellensatz) and semidenite programming.

To this end, an LMI formulation for the sums of squares decomposition for
multivariable polynomials is presented. Based on this, it is shown how to construct
sufficient Positivstellensatz-based convex tests to prove that certain sets are empty.
Among other applications, this leads to a nonlinear extension of many LMI based
results in uncertain linear system analysis.
Within the same framework, we develop stronger criteria for matrix copositivity,
and generalizations of the well-known standard semidenite relaxations for quadratic
programming.
Some applications to new and previously studied problems are presented. A few
examples are Lyapunov function computation, robust bifurcation analysis, structured
singular values, etc. It is shown that the proposed methods allow for improved
solutions for very diverse questions in continuous and combinatorial optimization. },

@article{Burstedt1997,
abstract = {We investigated the coordination of fingertip forces in subjects who used the tips of two fingers to restrain an instrumented manipulandum with horizontally oriented grip surfaces. The grip surfaces were subjected to tangential pulling forces in the distal direction in relation to the fingers. The subjects used either the right index and middle fingers (unimanual grasp) or both index fingers (bimanual grasp) to restrain the manipulandum. To change the frictional condition at the digit-object interfaces, either both grip surfaces were covered with sandpaper or one was covered with sandpaper and the other with rayon. The forces applied normally and tangentially to the grip surfaces were measured separately at each plate along with the position of the plates. Subjects could have performed the present task successfully with many different force distributions between the digits. However, they partitioned the load in a manner that reflected the frictional condition at the local digit-object interfaces. When both digits contacted sandpaper, they typically partitioned the load symmetrically, but when one digit made contact with rayon and the other with sandpaper, the digit contacting the less slippery material (sandpaper) took up a larger part of the load. The normal forces were also influenced by the frictional condition, but they reflected the average friction at the two contact sites rather than the local friction. That is, when friction was low at one of the digit-object interfaces, only the applied normal forces increased at both digits. Thus sensory information related to the local frictional condition at the respective digit-object interfaces controlled the normal force at both digits. The normal:tangential force ratio at each digit appeared to be a controlled variable. It was adjusted independently at each digit to the minimum ratio required to prevent frictional slippage, keeping an adequate safety margin against slippage. This was accomplished by the scaling of the normal forces to the average friction and by partitioning of the load according to frictional differences between the digit-object interfaces. In conclusion, by adjusting the normal:tangential force ratios to the local frictional condition, subjects avoided excessive normal forces at the individual digit-object interfaces, and by partitioning the load according the frictional difference, subjects avoided high normal forces. Thus the local frictional condition at the separate digit-object interfaces is one factor that can strongly influence the distribution of forces across digits engaged in a manipulative act.},

Here, we employ tools from stochastic processes to examine the “stochastic stability” of idealized rimless-wheel and compass-gait walking on randomly generated uneven terrain.
