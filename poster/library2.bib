abstract = {Friction and gravity represent two basic physical constraints of terrestrial locomotion that affect both motor patterns and the biomechanics of bipedal gait. To provide insights into the spatiotemporal organization of the motor output in connection with ground contact forces, we studied adaptation of human gait to steady low-friction conditions. Subjects walked along a slippery walkway (7 m long; friction coefficient approximately 0.06) or a normal, nonslippery floor at a natural speed. We recorded gait kinematics, ground reaction forces, and bilateral electromyographic (EMG) activity of 16 leg and trunk muscles and we mapped the recorded EMG patterns onto the spinal cord in approximate rostrocaudal locations of the motoneuron (MN) pools to characterize the spatiotemporal organization of the motor output. The results revealed several idiosyncratic features of walking on the slippery surface. The step length, cycle duration, and horizontal shear forces were significantly smaller, the head orientation tended to be stabilized in space, whereas arm movements, trunk rotations, and lateral trunk inclinations considerably increased and foot motion and gait kinematics resembled those of a nonplantigrade gait. Furthermore, walking on the slippery surface required stabilization of the hip and of the center-of-body mass in the frontal plane, which significantly improved with practice. Motor patterns were characterized by an enhanced (roughly twofold) level of MN activity, substantial decoupling of anatomical synergists, and the absence of systematic displacements of the center of MN activity in the lumbosacral enlargement. Overall, the results show that when subjects are confronted with unsteady surface conditions, like the slippery floor, they adopt a gait mode that tends to keep the COM centered over the supporting limbs and to increase limb stiffness. We suggest that this behavior may represent a distinct gait mode that is particularly suited to uncertain surface conditions in general.},

In the realization of fast galloping, the trajectory design is important. For a galloping trajectory, we propose an elliptic leg trajectory, which provides simplified locomotion to complex galloping motions of animals. However, the elliptic trajectory, as an imitation of animal galloping motion, does not guarantee stability and minimal energy consumption. We propose optimization based on energy and stability using a genetic algorithm, which provides a robust and globally optimized solution to this multi-body, highly nonlinear dynamic system. To evaluate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory, a series of computer simulations were carried out. {\textcopyright} KSME {\&} Springer 2009.},

The authors begin this article by arguing that the evaluation of new ideas is a complex process involving forecasting, appraisal, and revision, where different standards might be applied to different ideas during appraisal and revision. The influence of appraisal and revision standards on creative problem solving was examined by asking 148 undergraduates to appraise and revise highly original, original, and nonoriginal ideas generated for an advertising campaign under conditions in which the standards to be applied stressed the generation of new ideas or under conditions in which the standards to be applied stressed efficiency of current operations. It was found that better plans for these advertising campaigns were obtained when generative, or innovative, criteria were applied to less original ideas and when implementation efficiency, or operating, criteria were applied to more original ideas. It was concluded that evaluation may serve to remediate deficiencies in ideas but that the standards applied must vary with the nature of the idea and the context in which it is to be implemented},

abstract = {Locomotion results from complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamically coupled interactions between an organism and its environment. Fortunately, simple models we call templates have been and can be made to resolve the redundancy of multiple legs, joints and muscles by seeking synergies and symmetries. A template is the simplest model (least number of variables and parameters) that exhibits a targeted behavior. For example, diverse species that differ in skeletal type, leg number and posture run in a stable manner like sagittal- and horizontal-plane spring-mass systems. Templates suggest control strategies that can be tested against empirical data. Templates must be grounded in more detailed morphological and physiological models to ask specific questions about multiple legs, the joint torques that actuate them, the recruitment of muscles that produce those torques and the neural networks that activate the ensemble. We term these more elaborate models anchors. They introduce representations of specific biological details whose mechanism of coordination is of interest. Since mechanisms require controls, anchors incorporate specific hypotheses concerning the manner in which unnecessary motion or energy from legs, joints and muscles is removed, leaving behind the behavior of the body in the low-degree-of-freedom template. Locating the origin of control is a challenge because neural and mechanical systems are dynamically coupled and both play a role. The control of slow, variable-frequency locomotion appears to be dominated by the nervous system, whereas during rapid, rhythmic locomotion, the control may reside more within the mechanical system. Anchored templates of many-legged, sprawled-postured animals suggest that passive, dynamic self-stabilization from a feedforward, tuned mechanical system can reject rapid perturbations and simplify control. Future progress would benefit from the creation of a field embracing comparative neuromechanics.},

abstract = {The well-known condition for standing stability in static situations is that the vertical projection of the centre of mass (CoM) should be within the base of support (BoS). On the basis of a simple inverted pendulum model, an extension of this rule is proposed for dynamical situations: the position of (the vertical projection of) the CoM plus its velocity times a factor l/g should be within the BoS, l being leg length and g the acceleration of gravity. It is proposed to name this vector quantity 'extrapolated centre of mass position' (XcoM). The definition suggests as a measure of stability the 'margin of stability' b , the minimum distance from XcoM to the boundaries of the BoS. An alternative measure is the temporal stability margin ??, the time in which the boundary of the BoS would be reached without intervention. Some experimental data of subjects standing on one or two feet, flatfoot and tiptoe, are presented to give an idea of the usual ranges of these margins of stability. Example data on walking are also presented. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Konow2015,
abstract = {During downhill running, manoeuvring, negotiation of obstacles and landings from a jump, mechanical energy is dissipated via active lengthening of limb muscles. Tendon compliance provides a 'shock-absorber' mechanism that rapidly absorbs mechanical energy and releases it more slowly as the recoil of the tendon does work to stretch muscle fascicles. By lowering the rate of muscular energy dissipation, tendon compliance likely reduces the risk of muscle injury that can result from rapid and forceful muscle lengthening. Here, we examine how muscle-tendon mechanics are modulated in response to changes in demand for energy dissipation. We measured lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle activity, force and fascicle length, as well as leg joint kinematics and ground-reaction force, as turkeys performed drop-landings from three heights (0.5-1.5 m centre-of-mass elevation). Negative work by the LG muscle-tendon unit during landing increased with drop height, mainly owing to greater muscle recruitment and force as drop height increased. Although muscle strain did not increase with landing height, ankle flexion increased owing to increased tendon strain at higher muscle forces. Measurements of the length-tension relationship of the muscle indicated that the muscle reached peak force at shorter and likely safer operating lengths as drop height increased. Our results indicate that tendon compliance is important to the modulation of energy dissipation by active muscle with changes in demand and may provide a mechanism for rapid adjustment of function during deceleration tasks of unpredictable intensity.},

abstract = {Algorithms and computational complexity measures for simulating the motion of contacting bodies with friction are presented. The bodies are restricted to be perfectly rigid bodies that contact at finitely many points. Contact forces between bodies must satisfy the Coulomb model of friction. A traditional principle of mechanics is that contact forces are impulsive if and only if non-impulsive contact forces are insufficient to maintain the non-penetration constraints between bodies. When friction is allowed, it is known that impulsive contact forces can be necessary even in the absence of collisions between bodies. This paper shows that computing contact forces according to this traditional principle is likely to require exponential time. An analysis of this result reveals that the principle for when impulses can occur is too restrictive, and a natural reformulation of the principle is proposed. Using the reformulated principle, an algorithm with expected polynomial time behavior for computing contact forces is presented.},

abstract = {The Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) is considered the simplest model to effectively describe bouncing gaits (such as running and hopping) for many legged animals and robots. For this reason, it is has often been used as a model for robot design. A key challenge in using this model, however, is the lack of a closed-form solution for the equations of motion that define the stance phase of its dynamics. This results in the impossibility of analytically predicting its trajectory. Consequently, developing a practical control strategy to operate on the model is computationally intensive, because accurately predicting the step-to-step dynamics is still an unsolved problem. By adding an actuator in series with the spring, we can develop a control law for actuator displacement which enforces a desired trajectory during stance. In particular, for our specific chosen control law, we can compute an analytical solution for the stance phase trajectory. Furthermore, we give examples of higher level control strategies for foothold placement and for keeping the forward velocity or the apex height constant on rough terrain that employ our low-level control laws, and we illustrate through simulations the performance typical of our strategy.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use a 7-link, moment-actuated human model to predict, at liftoff of the trailing foot in gait, the threshold of the center of mass (COM) velocity relative to the base of support (BOS) required to prevent backward balance loss during single stance recovery from a slip. Five dynamic optimization problems were solved to find the minimum COM velocities that would allow the simulation to terminate with the COM above the BOS when the COM started 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 foot lengths behind the heel of the stance foot (i.e., behind the BOS). The initial joint angles of the model were based on averaged data from experimental trials. Foot-ground contact was modeled using 16 visco-elastic springs distributed under the stance foot. Slipping was modeled by setting the sliding coefficient of friction of these springs to 0.02. The forward velocity of the COM necessary to avoid a backward balance loss is nearly two times larger under slip conditions under non-slip conditions. The predicted threshold for backward balance loss following a slip agreed well with experimental data collected from 99 young adults in response to 927 slips during walking. In all trials in which a subject's COM had a velocity below the predicted threshold, the subject's recovery foot landed posterior to the slipping foot as predicted. Finally, combining experimental data with optimization, we verified that the 7-link model could more accurately predict gait stability than a 2-link model. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture: we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect to layer parameters; we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which provides backpropaga-tion gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of the solve; and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems. In one notable example, we show that the method is capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a pri-ori information about the rules of the game; this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard constraints better than other neural architec-tures.},

Learning physics-based locomotion skills is a diicult problem, leading to solutions that typically exploit prior knowledge of various forms. In this paper we aim to learn a variety of environment-aware locomotion skills with a limited amount of prior knowledge. We adopt a two-level hierarchical control framework. First, low-level controllers are learned that operate at a ane timescale and which achieve robust walking gaits that satisfy stepping-target and style objectives. Second, high-level controllers are then learned which plan at the timescale of steps by invoking desired step targets for the low-level controller. The high-level controller makes decisions directly based on high-dimensional inputs, including terrain maps or other suitable representations of the surroundings. Both levels of the control policy are trained using deep reinforcement learning. Results are demonstrated on a simulated 3D biped. Low-level controllers are learned for a variety of motion styles and demonstrate robustness with respect to force-based disturbances, terrain variations, and style interpolation. High-level controllers are demonstrated that are capable of following trails through terrains, dribbling a soccer ball towards a target location, and navigating through static or dynamic obstacles.},

abstract = {New models and theories of legged locomotion are needed to better explain and predict the robustly stable legged locomotion of animals and some bio-inspired robots. In this paper we observe that a hip-torque and leg-damping mechanism is fundamental to many legged robots and some animals and determine its affect on locomotion dynamics. We discuss why this hip-torque-and-leg-damping mechanism is not so easily understood. We investigate how hip-torque and leg-damping affect the stability and robustness of locomotion using a mathematical model: First, we extend the canonical spring-loaded-inverted-pendulum model to include constant hip torque and leg damping proportional to leg length speed. Then, we calculate the stability and robustness of locomotion as a function of increasing levels of torque and damping, starting from zero-the energy conserving and marginally stable special case-to high levels of torque and damping. We find that the stabilizing effects of hip-torque and leg-damping occur in the context of the piecewise-continuous dynamics of legged locomotion, and so linear intuition does not apply. We discover that adding hip torque and leg damping changes the stability of legged locomotion in an unexpected way. When a small amount of torque and damping are added, legged locomotion is initially destabilized. As more torque and damping are added, legged locomotion turns stable and becomes increasingly more stable and more robust the more torque and damping are added. Also, stable locomotion becomes more probable over the biologically-relevant region of the parameter space, indicating greater prediction and explanatory capabilities of the model. These results provide a more clear understanding of the hip-torque-and-leg-damping mechanism of legged locomotion, and extend existing theory of legged locomotion towards a greater understanding of robustly stable locomotion.},

abstract = {Pushing is a motion primitive useful to handle objects that are too large, too heavy, or too cluttered to be grasped. It is at the core of much of robotic manipulation, in particular when physical interaction is involved. It seems reasonable then to wish for robots to understand how pushed objects move. In reality, however, robots often rely on approximations which yield models that are computable, but also restricted and inaccurate. Just how close are those models? How reasonable are the assumptions they are based on? To help answer these questions, and to get a better experimental understanding of pushing, we present a comprehensive and high-fidelity dataset of planar pushing experiments. The dataset contains timestamped poses of a circular pusher and a pushed object, as well as forces at the interaction. We vary the push interaction in 6 dimensions: surface material, shape of the pushed object, contact position, pushing direction, pushing speed, and pushing acceleration. An industrial robot automates the data capturing along precisely controlled position-velocity-acceleration trajec-tories of the pusher, which give dense samples of positions and forces of uniform quality. We finish the paper by characterizing the variability of friction, and evaluating the most common assumptions and simplifications made by models of frictional pushing in robotics.},

abstract = {One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, dynamics are approximated by physics-based analytical models. These models rely on specific state representations that may be hard to obtain from raw sensory data, especially if no knowledge of the object shape is assumed. More recently, we have seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of complex physical interactions directly from sensory input. It is however an open question how far these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we investigate the advantages and limitations of neural network based learning approaches for predicting the effects of actions based on sensory input and show how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of both worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which there exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We propose to use a convolutional neural network to convert raw depth images or organized point clouds into a suitable representation for the analytical model and compare this approach to using neural networks for both, perception and prediction. A systematic evaluation of the proposed approach on a very large real-world dataset shows two main advantages of the hybrid architecture. Compared to a pure neural network, it significantly (i) reduces required training data and (ii) improves generalization to novel physical interaction.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether stability and limb support play a similar role in governing slip outcome in gait-slip as in sit-to-stand-slip, and whether such prediction could also be derived based on measures of these variables during regular, unperturbed movements. Fifty-three and forty-one young subjects all took one recovery step following an unannounced, novel, forward slip induced in gait and in sit-to-stand, respectively. Logistic regression was used to predict recovery outcome based on preslip and reactive measures of stability and limb support across tasks. Following slip onset, all subjects in both tasks experienced rapid decay in stability and limb support (indicated by a hip descent), leading to some actual falls that could not have been predicted from regular, preslip walking. Immediately before recovery step touchdown, stability and limb support could together best predict 88.9{\%} and 100{\%} falls, respectively, for gait-slip and sit-to-stand-slip. Because of differences in the execution of the recovery step, stability became a better predictor of fallers in sit-to-stand-slip than in gait-slip after recovery limb touchdown. Recovery steps were highly effective in restoring stability, regardless of outcome and task. The predictive strength of stability diminished in gait-slip or reduced in sit-to-stand-slip after recovery touchdown, while limb support remained able to differentiate fallers from those who recovered in both tasks. When slip-induced instability was combined with inadequate limb support, falls were nearly inevitable in both tasks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Since the contact introduces non-smooth dynamics, many standard algorithms of optimal control and reinforcement learning cannot be directly applied to such domains. We use a smooth contact model that can compute inverse dynamics through the contact, thereby avoiding hybrid representation of the non-smooth contact state. This allows us to formulate an unconstrained, continuous trajec- tory optimization problem, which can be solved using standard optimization tools.We demonstrate our approach by optimizing a running gait for a 31-dimensional simulated humanoid. The resulting gait is demonstrated in a movie attached as supplementary material. Most notably, the optimization result exhibits a synchronous motion of the arm and the opposite leg, eliminating undesired angular momentum; this is a key feature of bipedal running, and its emergence attests to the power of the optimization process.},

abstract = {The kinematics of lizard locomotion has been extensively studied, focusing mainly on steady running over level ground or over uniformly inclined surfaces. However, lizards inhabit structurally complex environments and frequently encounter small physical barriers located along their traveling routes. Consequently, the ability to climb obstacles is likely ecologically advantageous for small vertebrates because it allows expansion of their spatial niche across distinct microhabitats. Our study tests which aspects of lizard kinematics change to improve the negotiation of obstacles that might be encountered along traveling routes. We examined the kinematics of Sceloporus malachiticus using high-speed (500 fps) digital video as individuals moved over rectangular obstacles with three different heights (0.8, 1.8 and 3.8 cm; 22, 49 and 103{\%} of the lizards' mean forelimb length: wrist to shoulder), as well as during steady level running. Our results show that S. malachiticus lizards increase vertical relative to horizontal limb motion and elevate their head and trunk in anticipation of moving over an obstacle. The lizards generally appeared to use their forelimbs as levers to pull their body over higher obstacles, whereas the hindlimbs pushed against the ground to propel the pelvis forward and upward. Elevation of the center of the trunk in preparatory strides (23.83 and 37.85 mm, low vs. high obstacle) and forelimb support duty factor (0.33 vs. 0.45, low vs. high obstacle) increased with obstacle height, whereas locomotor speed and stepping frequency decreased from steady level running (0.89 m s{\^{a}}ˆ1 and 6.87 Hz) when moving over the highest obstacle (0.62 m s{\^{a}}ˆ1 and 5.74 Hz). Lizards paused more frequently on high obstacles, and made more adjustments of hand and foot contact positions with increased barrier height. They also jumped and ran bipedally more frequently to negotiate higher obstacles. This study shows that both kinematic and behavioral strategies are used by small vertebrates with a sprawled posture to help negotiate obstacles.

abstract = {Slipping during various kinds of movement often leads to potentially dangerous incidents of falling. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was evidence to support the theory that movement strategies could be used by individuals to regain stability during an episode of slipping and whether forced sliding from a moving platform accurately simulated the effect of slipping on stability and balance. A single-link-plus-foot biomechanical model was used to mathematically simulate base of support (BOS) translation and body segment rotation during movement termination in sagittal plane. An optimization routine was used to determine region of stability [defined at given COM locations as the feasible range of horizontal velocities of the center of mass (COM) of human subject that can be reduced to zero with respect to the BOS while still allowing the COM to traverse within the BOS limits]. We found some 30{\%} overlap in the region of stability for slipping and non-slipping conditions. This finding supports the theory that movement strategies can be sought for restoring stability and balance even if slipping unexpectedly occurs. We also found that forced sliding produces effects on stability that are similar to those of slipping, indicated by over 50{\%} overlap in the regions of stability for the two conditions. In addition, forced sliding has distinctive effects on stability, including a 'shift' of the region of stability extended beyond the BOS in the direction of sliding. These findings may provide quantifiable guidance for balance training aimed at reducing fall incidents under uncertain floor surface conditions. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {A significant number of injuries in the workplace is attributed to slips and falls. Biomechanical responses to actual slip events determine whether the outcome of a slip will be recovery or a fall. The goal of this study was to examine lower extremity joint moments and postural adjustments for experimental evidence of corrective strategies evoked during slipping in an attempt to prevent falling. Sixteen subjects walked onto a possibly oily vinyl tile floor, while ground reaction forces and body motion were recorded at 350Hz. The onset of corrective reactions by the body in an attempt to recover from slips became evident at about 25{\%} of stance and continued until about 45{\%} into stance, i.e. on average between 190 and 350ms after heel contact. These reactions included increased flexion moment at the knee and extensor activity at the hip. The ankle, on the other hand, acted as a passive joint (no net moment) during fall trials. Joint kinematics showed increased knee flexion and forward rotation of the shank in an attempt to bring the foot back towards the body. Once again, the ankle kinematics appeared to play a less dominant role (compared to the knee) in recovery attempts. This study indicates that humans generate corrective reactions to slips that are different than previously reported responses to standing perturbations translating the supporting surface.

abstract = {Trotting and hopping animals use muscles, tendons and ligaments to store and return elastic energy as they bounce along the ground. We examine how the musculoskeletal spring system operates at different speeds and in animals of different sizes. We model trotting and hopping as a simple spring-mass system which consists of a leg spring and a mass. We find that the stiffness of the leg spring (k(leg)) is nearly independent of speed in dogs, goats, horses and red kangaroos. As these animals trot or hop faster, the leg spring sweeps a greater angle during the stance phase, and the vertical excursion of the center of mass during the ground contact phase decreases. The combination of these changes to the spring system causes animals to bounce off the ground more quickly at higher speeds. Analysis of a wide size range of animals (0.1-140 kg) at equivalent speeds reveals that larger animals have stiffer leg springs (k(leg) [symbol: see text] M0.67, where M is body mass), but that the angle swept by the leg spring is nearly independent of body mass. As a result, the resonant period of vertical vibration of the spring-mass system is longer in larger animals. The length of time that the feet are in contact with the ground increases with body mass in nearly the same way as the resonant period of vertical vibration.},

Two manipulations of participants' processing of the available ideas (exclusion instructions and quality ratings) had no effect on selection effectiveness.

abstract = {The spring-loaded inverted pendulum ( SLIP) model describes well the steady-state center-of-mass motions of a diverse range of walking and running animals and robots. Here we ask whether the SLIP model can also explain the dynamic stability of these gaits, and we find that it cannot do so in many physically-relevant parameter ranges. We develop an actuated, lossy, clock-torqued SLIP, or CT-SLIP, with more realistic hip-motor torque inputs, that can capture the robust stability properties observed inmost animals and some legged robots. Variations of CT-SLIP at a similar level of detail and complexity may also be appropriate for capturing the whole-system center-of-mass dynamics of locomotion of legged animals and robots varying widely in size and morphology. This paper contributes to a broader program to develop mathematical models, at varied levels of detail, that capture the dynamics of integrated organismal systems exhibiting integrated whole-body motion.},

abstract = {Synthesis of legged locomotion through dynamic simulation is useful for exploration of the mechanical and control variables that contribute to efficient gait. Most previous simula-tions have made use of periodicity constraints, a sensible choice for investigations of steady-state walking or running. Sprinting from rest, however, is aperiodic by nature and this aperiodicity is central to the goal of the movement, as performance is determined in large part by a rapid acceleration phase early in the race. The purpose of this study was to create a novel simulation of aperiodic sprinting using a modified spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) biped model. The optimal control problem was to find the set of controls that minimized the time for the model to run 20 m, and this problem was solved using a direct multiple shooting algorithm that converts the original continuous time problem into piecewise discrete subproblems. The resulting nonlinear programming problem was solved iteratively using a sequential quadratic programming method. The starting point for the optimizer was an initial guess simulation that was a slow alternating-gait "jogging" simu-lation developed using proportional-derivative feedback to control trunk attitude, swing leg angle, and leg retraction and extension. The optimized aperiodic sprint simulation solution yielded a substantial improvement in locomotion time over the initial guess (2.79s versus 6.64 s). Following optimization, the model produced forward impulses at the start of the sprint that were four times greater than those of the initial guess simulation, producing more rapid acceleration. Several gait features demonstrated in the optimized sprint simula-tion correspond to behaviors of human sprinters: forward trunk lean at the start; straight-ening of the trunk during acceleration; and a dive at the finish. Optimization resulted in reduced foot contact times (0.065 s versus 0.210 s), but contact times early in the optimized simulation were longer to facilitate acceleration. The present study represents the first sim-ulation of multistep aperiodic sprinting with optimal controls. Although the minimized objective function was simple, the model replicated several complex behaviors such as modulation of the foot contact and executing a forward dive at the finish line. None of these observed behaviors were imposed explicitly by constraints but rather were "discovered" by the optimizer. These methods will be extended by addition of musculotendon actuators and joints in order to gain understanding of the infiuence of musculoskeletal mechanics on gait speed.},

The first few sections describe the two classes of transcription methods (shooting {\&} simultaneous) that are used to convert the trajectory optimization problem into a general constrained optimization form. Hello World! The middle of the report discusses a few extensions to the basic methods, including how to deal with hybrid systems (such as walking robots). The final section goes over a variety of implementation details. 1 Optimal Control Overview There are three types of algorithms for solving optimal control problems[4]: • Dynamic Programming: Solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations over the entire state space. • Indirect Methods: Transcribe problem then find where the slope of the objective is zero. • Direct Methods: Transcribe problem then find the minimum of the objective function. Dynamic programming is an excellent solution to the optimal control problem for unconstrained low-dimensional systems, but it does not scale well to high-dimensional systems, since it requires a discretization of the full state space. Indirect methods tend to be numerically unstable and are difficult to implement and initialize [2]. For the remainder of this paper we will restrict focus to direct methods for transcribing and solving the optimal control problem. The solution to an optimal control problem via transcription scales well to high-dimensional systems, but yields a single trajectory through state and control space, rather than a global policy like dynamic programming.},

abstract = {This paper presents “1STAR,” which is the first robot that is driven by a single actuator but can be directly commanded to move straight or turn clockwise or counterclockwise. The legged robot relies on a novel actuation gait, which exploits the compliance disparity between alternate stance tripods, to generate rotation by continuously accelerating and decelerating the legs. The direction of turning depends on the configuration of the legs-tripod left or right-and the timing of the acceleration and deceleration. Alternating leg acceleration in successive steps allows for continuous rotation in the desired direction. The turning radius can be varied by changing the timing of the leg acceleration and deceleration without changing the cycle frequency and linear speed. A simplified kinematic motion model of a robot is presented, and a dynamic simulation is performed to analyze the behavior and optimize robot parameters. The locomotion gait is verified experimentally using our newly designed “1STAR” robot.},

abstract = {Falls precipitated by slipping are a major health concern, with the majority of all slip-related falls occurring during gait. Recent evidence shows that a faster and/or more anteriorly positioned center of mass (COM) is more stable against backward balance loss, and that compensatory stepping is the key to recovering stability upon balance loss. The purposes of this paper were to determine whether walking speed affected gait stability for backward balance loss at slip onset and touchdown of compensatory stepping, and whether compensatory stepping response resembled the regular gait pattern. Forty-seven young subjects were slipped unexpectedly either at a self-selected fast, natural or slow speed. Speed-related differences in stability at slip onset and touchdown of the subsequent compensatory step were analyzed using the COM position-velocity state. The results indicate that gait speed highly correlated with stability against backward balance loss at slip onset. The low COM velocity of the slow group was not sufficiently compensated for by a more anteriorly positioned COM associated with a shorter step length at slip onset. At touchdown of the compensatory step, the speed-related differences in stability diminished, due to the continued advantage of anterior COM positioning from a short compensatory step retained by the slow group, coupled with an increase in COM velocity. Compensatory step length and relative COM position altered as a function of gait speed, indicating the motor program for gait regulation may play a role in modulating the compensatory step. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The benefits of the proposed changes are evaluated with the models of a 1D hopper and a 2D bipedal robot, and we additionally compare our results with analytic solutions and an established multiple shooting implementation.

Our method enhances the expressiveness of the standard Coulomb contact model by learning the contact behaviors from the observed data, while preserving the fundamental contact constraints whenever possible. For example, a classifier is trained to approximate the transitions between static and dynamic frictions, while non-penetration constraint during collision is enforced analytically.

Our goal is to explore under what conditions, and to what degree , the observation of physical interaction, in the form of motions and/or forces, is indicative of the underlying dynamics that governs it. In this initial study we consider the cases of passive interaction, where an object free-falls under gravity, and active interaction, where known external perturbations act on the object at contact. We assume that both object and environment are planar and rigid, and exploit the well-known complementarity formulation for contact resolution to establish a closed-form relationship between inertial parameters, contact forces, and observed motions. Consistent with intuition, the analysis indicates that without the application of known external forces, the identifiable set of parameters remains coupled, i.e., the ratio of mass moment of inertia to mass and the ratio of contact forces to the mass. Interestingly, the analysis also shows that known external forces can lead to decoupling and identifiability of mass, mass moment of inertia, and normal and tangential contact forces. We evaluate the identifiability formulation both in simulation and with real experiments.},

This article reviews a new conceptual framework on dynamic stability and weight support in reducing the risk for falls resulting from a forward slip, based on the principles of motor control and learning, in the context of adaptation and longer-term retention induced by repeated-slip training. Although an unexpected slip is severely destabilizing, a recovery step often is adequate for regaining stability, regardless of age. Consequently, poor weight support (quantified by reduction in hip height), rather than instability, is the major determinant of slip-related fall risk. Promisingly, a single session of repeated-slip training can enhance neuromechanical control of dynamic stability and weight support to prevent falls, which can be retained for several months or longer. These principles provide the theoretical basis for establishing task-specific adaptive training that facilitates the development of protective strategies to reduce falls among older adults.},

abstract = {Although people's legs are capable of a broad range of muscle-use and gait patterns, they generally prefer just two. They walk, swinging their body over a relatively straight leg with each step, or run, bouncing up off a bent leg between aerial phases. Walking feels easiest when going slowly, and running feels easiest when going faster. More unusual gaits seem more tiring. Perhaps this is because walking and running use the least energy. Addressing this classic conjecture with experiments requires comparing walking and running with many other strange and unpractised gaits. As an alternative, a basic understanding of gait choice might be obtained by calculating energy cost by using mechanics-based models. Here we use a minimal model that can describe walking and running as well as an infinite variety of other gaits. We use computer optimization to find which gaits are indeed energetically optimal for this model. At low speeds the optimization discovers the classic inverted-pendulum walk, at high speeds it discovers a bouncing run, even without springs, and at intermediate speeds it finds a new pendular-running gait that includes walking and running as extreme cases.},

Dynamic models for bipeds are hybrid in nature. They contain both continuous and discrete elements, with switching events that are governed by a combination of unilateral constraints and impulse-like forces that occur at foot touchdown. Control laws for these machines must be hybrid as well.

More specifically, this paper presents an algorithm to simulate a meter stick trick using a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) formulation. A meter stick, modeled as a planar uniform horizontal rod in gravity, is supported by two point contacts or "fingers". We developed a LCP-based algorithm to simulate motion of the meter stick when one finger moves toward the other at a fixed speed. The simulation matches observations of physical meter stick trick experiments. Overall, this paper shows that a LCP-based algorithm is a robust option to naturally capture the switching contact modes in a dynamical simulation of an object with multiple contacts.},

Empirical research on the role of the unconscious in creativity, though, is inconsistent and thus far has focused mainly on one aspect of the creative process - idea generation. This is the first study to assess the role of the unconscious mind for both idea generation and idea selection. Participants generated creative ideas immediately, after conscious thought, or after a period of distraction during which unconscious thought was hypothesized to take place. After having listed their ideas, participants selected their most creative idea. Performance in idea generation was similar between conscious and unconscious thought; however, individuals who had unconsciously thought about ideas were better in selecting their most creative idea. These findings shed more light on the role of unconscious processes in creativity, and provide a means to enhance creative performance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Rather than learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-NETS predict SE(3) transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that the structure underlying SE3-NETS enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks.

abstract = {Spring-mass models have been very successful both in describing and generating running behaviors. Control of system energy within these models takes different forms, among which the use of a linear actuator in series with the leg spring has been preferred by many recent monopedal and bipedal platform designs due to its relative robustness and simplicity. However, the validity of the well-known Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model of running for such platforms can only preserved under a specific family of control strategies to drive the actuator. In this paper, we propose a novel controller in this family, based on the idea of embedding a lossy SLIP template with a tunable damping coefficient into the linearly actuated compliant leg system. We show that this maximizes energy input within a single stride, allows decreased power requirements on the actuator compared to alternative methods, while preserving the validity and accuracy of analytic solutions and model-based controllers. We present systematic simulations to establish performance gains with respect to the commonly investigated method of modulating leg stiffness. Enabling the most efficient use of actuator power in this manner while preserving analytic tractability will allow efficient and accurate control of running for linearly actuated compliant leg designs.},

Currently, robots are often treated as a black box in this optimization process, which is the reason why derivative-free optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning are omnipresent. When gradient-based methods are used, models are kept small or rely on finite difference approximations for the Jacobian. This method quickly grows expensive with increasing numbers of parameters, such as found in deep learning. We propose the implementation of a modern physics engine, which can differentiate control parameters. This engine is implemented for both CPU and GPU. Firstly, this paper shows how such an engine speeds up the optimization process, even for small problems. Furthermore, it explains why this is an alternative approach to deep Q-learning, for using deep learning in robotics. Finally, we argue that this is a big step for deep learning in robotics, as it opens up new possibilities to optimize robots, both in hardware and software.},

abstract = {The purposes of this analysis were to predict the feasible movements during which balance can be maintained, based on environmental (contact force), anatomical (foot geometry), and physiological (muscle strength) constraints, and to identify the role of each constraint in limiting movement. An inverted pendulum model with a foot segment was used with an optimization algorithm to determine the set of feasible center of mass (CM) velocity-position combinations for movement termination. The upper boundary of the resulting feasible region ran from a velocity of 1.1 s-1 (normalized to body height) at 2.4 foot lengths behind the heel, to 0.45 s-1 over the heel, to zero over the toe, and the lower boundary from a velocity of 0.9 s-1 at 2.7 foot lengths behind the heel, to zero over the heel. Forward falls would be initiated if states exceeded the upper boundary, and backward falls would be initiated if the states fell below the lower boundary. Under normal conditions, the constraint on the size of the base of support (BOS) determined the upper and lower boundaries of the feasible region. However, friction and strength did limit the feasible region when friction levels were less than 0.82, when dorsiflexion was reduced more than 51{\%}, or when plantar flexion strength was reduced more than 35{\%}. These findings expand the long-held concept that balance is based on CM position limits (i.e. the horizontal CM position has to be confined within the BOS to guarantee stable standing) to a concept based on CM velocity-position limits.},

Accordingly, 181 undergraduates were asked to evaluate the originality of marketing campaigns being developed by six different teams where the level of idea originality was varied. Manipulations were induced to encourage active analysis of interactional processes and the originality of team products. It was found that active analysis of product originality and appraisal of interactional processes reduced errors in evaluating the originality of highly novel ideas.

abstract = {One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, dynamics are approximated by physics-based analytical models. These models rely on specific state representations that may be hard to obtain from raw sensory data, especially if no knowledge of the object shape is assumed. More recently, we have seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of complex physical interactions directly from sensory input. It is however an open question how far these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we investigate the advantages and limitations of neural network based learning approaches for predicting the effects of actions based on sensory input and show how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of both worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which there exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We propose to use a convolutional neural network to convert raw depth images or organized point clouds into a suitable representation for the analytical model and compare this approach to using neural networks for both, perception and prediction. A systematic evaluation of the proposed approach on a very large real-world dataset shows two main advantages of the hybrid architecture. Compared to a pure neural network, it significantly (i) reduces required training data and (ii) improves generalization to novel physical interaction.},

abstract = {When humans and other mammals run, the body's complex system of muscle, tendon and ligament springs behaves like a single linear spring ('leg spring'). A simple spring-mass model, consisting of a single linear leg spring and a mass equivalent to the animal's mass, has been shown to describe the mechanics of running remarkably well. Force platform measurements from running animals, including humans, have shown that the stiffness of the leg spring remains nearly the same at all speeds and that the spring-mass system is adjusted for higher speeds by increasing the angle swept by the leg spring. The goal of the present study is to determine the relative importance of changes to the leg spring stiffness and the angle swept by the leg spring when humans alter their stride frequency at a given running speed. Human subjects ran on treadmill-mounted force platform at 2.5m s-1 while using a range of stride frequencies from 26{\%} below to 36{\%} above the preferred stride frequency. Force platform measurements revealed that the stiffness of the leg spring increased by 2.3-fold from 7.0 to 16.3 kNm-1 between the lowest and highest stride frequencies. The angle swept by the leg spring decreased at higher stride frequencies, partially offsetting the effect of the increased leg spring stiffness on the mechanical behavior of the spring-mass system. We conclude that the most important adjustment to the body's spring system to accommodate higher stride frequencies is that leg spring becomes stiffer.},

Nominal and interactive groups performed a task that involved idea generation and selection. Idea generation and selection were strictly separated for half the groups, but were combined for the other half. Nominal groups generated more ideas than interactive groups, and the ideas generated by nominal groups were more original and less feasible than the ideas generated by interactive groups. However, there were no differences among conditions in quality of the selected ideas. Further, idea selection was not significantly better than chance.

abstract = {This paper introduces an accurate yet analytically simple approximation to the stance dynamics of the Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model in the presence of non-negligible damping and non-symmetric stance trajectories. Since the SLIP model has long been established as an accurate descriptive model for running behaviors, its careful analysis is instrumental in the design of successful locomotion controllers. Unfortunately, none of the existing analytic methods in the literature explicitly take damping into account, resulting in degraded predictive accuracy when they are used for dissipative runners. We show that the methods we propose not only yield average predictive errors below 2{\%} in the presence of significant damping, but also outperform existing alternatives to approximate the trajectories of a lossless model. Finally, we exploit both the predictive performance and analytic simplicity of our approximations in the design of a gait-level running controller, demonstrating their practical utility and performance benefits.},

abstract = {Official statistics indicate that slipping is one of the most common causes of accidents. Falls contribute to about 40{\%} of the 4000 fatal accidents that occur annually in Sweden. In fact, falls are more common than motor vehicles as a registered cause of accidental deaths. During 1975 occupational injuries caused approximately 3 million sickness-days and 26{\%} of them were due to falling accidents. The actual involvement of skidding cannot be evaluated, because slip-ups have been registered only as a subgroup of "falls on the same level". However, skidding may initiate other types of accidents as well. This is supported by preliminary data from a new occupational injury information system. The computer based system allows selective retrievals. In one of the first outputs slip-ups are involved in at least 25 accidents out of 102 including "fall to a lower level" during house construction work. Thus it is urgently necessary to improve the slipping resistance of shoes, floors and walking surfaces. Development is guided by friction measurement with different kinds of apparatus. Unfortunately, many of these are based on an oversimplified theory of static friction, which seems to be quite irrelevant due to the viscoelastic properties of shoe soles and heels. However, even if the apparatus measures dynamic friction, tests must be performed with forces and motions closely resembling a real human skid. Otherwise, friction measurements and real slipping resistance will be poorly correlated. Recently, a gait analysis system was developed which now has been used to evaluate force and motion data from walking and skidding subjects in the laboratory. The system includes piezoelectric and optoelectronic sensors connected on-line to a computer with substantial software for gait analysis. This paper presents the method and results such as: the average critical slip motion started 0.05 s after heel strike. At this point the vertical load was about 60{\%} of body weight and acting at the heel rear edge, the experiments usually resulting in a fall if the sliding exceeded 0.5 m s-1 in velocity or 0.1 m in distance. ?? 1981.},

abstract = {— This work demonstrates fast motion planning for robot locomotion that is optimized for terrain with complex dynamics, specifically, rapid penetration of granular media. Gait planning is critical for many legged locomotion control approaches, but they typically assume rigid ground contact. We aim to extend these planning methods to include terrain dynamics we see in the natural world, like sand and dirt, which can both deform and fluidize. Using an added-mass description of collective grain motion, we formulated a model of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic terrain effects that is both principled and representable with closed-form dynamics. As a result, we present a model and fast optimization formulation which solves accurate motion plans on granular media with tractable solving times (6.4±3.8 seconds). For validation, we optimized open-loop motor trajectories for a testbed jumping robot to jump to a target apex height from a bed a loosely packed poppy seeds, a model granular medium. While jumps optimized for rigid ground were anemic on granular media, terrain-aware trajectories hit within 6{\%} of their target. This demonstrates the potential for robot locomotion which meets practical task demands, all while being aware of the terrain beneath it.},

abstract = {In addition to divergent ideation, creative cognition requires specific evaluative strategies. Two evaluative skills were compared in this investigation, and the correlations of each with divergent thinking, critical thinking, and a measure of 'preference for ideation' were examined. One evaluative skill involved interpersonal judgments, and the other intrapersonal judgments. Correlational analyses indicated that there was a significant canonical correlation between inter- and intrapersonal evaluative scores (Rc = 0.63). There was also a significant correlation between intrapersonal evaluative accuracy and divergent thinking (Rc = 0.45), and a significant correlation between interpersonal evaluative accuracy and the preference for ideation (R = 0.31). Importantly, examinees were significantly more accurate when evaluating the uniqueness rather than the popularity of their own ideas, but significantly more accurate when evaluating the popularity rather than the uniqueness of ideas given by others. The highest percentage of correct identifications was for interpersonal evaluations, where 42{\%} of the popular ideas were correctly identified. The lowest category was intrapersonal evaluations, where only 21{\%} of the popular ideas were correctly identified. Finally, both inter- and intrapersonal evaluative scores had discriminant validity, being unrelated to standardized measures of critical thinking. These results are discussed in the context of current theories of creative thinking. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {A hybrid controller that induces provably stable running gaits on an asymmetric spring loaded inverted pendulum (ASLIP) is developed. The controller acts on two levels. On the first level, continuous within-stride control asymptotically imposes a (virtual) holonomic constraint corresponding to a desired torso posture, and creates an invariant surface on which the two-degree-of-freedom restriction dynamics of the closed-loop system (i.e., the hybrid zero dynamics) is diffeomorphic to the center-of-mass dynamics of a spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). On the second level, event-based control stabilizes the closed-loop hybrid system along a periodic orbit of the SLIP dynamics. The controller's performance is discussed through comparison with a second control law that creates a one-degree-of-freedom non-compliant hybrid zero dynamics. Both controllers induce identical steady-state behaviors (i.e., periodic solutions). Under transient conditions, however, the controller inducing a compliant hybrid zero dynamics based on the SLIP accommodates significantly larger disturbances, with less actuator effort, and without violation of the unilateral ground force constraints.},

abstract = {This work studies the problem of stochastic dynamic filtering and state propagation with complex beliefs. The main contribution is GP-SUM, a filtering algorithm tailored to dynamic systems and observation models expressed as Gaussian Processes (GP), and to states represented as a weighted Sum of Gaussians. The key attribute of GP-SUM is that it does not rely on linearizations of the dynamic or observation models, or on unimodal Gaussian approximations of the belief, hence enables tracking complex state distributions. The algorithm can be seen as a combination of a sampling-based filter with a probabilistic Bayes filter. On the one hand, GP-SUM operates by sampling the state distribution and propagating each sample through the dynamic system and observation models. On the other hand, it achieves effective sampling and accurate probabilistic propagation by relying on the GP form of the system, and the sum-of-Gaussian form of the belief. We show that GP-SUM outperforms several GP-Bayes and Particle Filters on a standard benchmark. We also demonstrate its use in a pushing task, predicting with experimental accuracy the naturally occurring non-Gaussian distributions.},

abstract = {The human musculo-skeletal system comprises high complexity which makes it difficult to identify underlying basic principles of bipedal locomotion. To tackle this challenge, a common approach is to strip away complexity and formulate a reductive model. With utter simplicity a bipedal spring-mass model gives good predictions of the human gait dynamics, however, it has not been fully investigated whether center of mass motion over time of walking and running is comparable between the model and the human body over a wide range of speed. To test the model's ability in this respect, we compare sagittal center of mass trajectories of model and human data for speeds ranging from 0.5 m/s to 4 m/s. For simulations, system parameters and initial conditions are extracted from experimental observations of 28 subjects. The leg parameters stiffness and length are extracted from functional fitting to the subjects' leg force-length curves. With small variations of the touch-down angle of the leg and the vertical position of the center of mass at apex, we find successful spring-mass simulations for moderate walking and medium running speeds. Predictions of the sagittal center of mass trajectories and ground reaction forces are good, but their amplitudes are overestimated, while contact time is underestimated. At faster walking speeds and slower running speeds we do not find successful model locomotion with the extent of allowed parameter variation. We conclude that the existing limitations may be improved by adding complexity to the model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Legged terrestrial animals must avoid falling while negotiating unexpected perturbations inherent to their structurally complex environments. Among humans, fatal and nonfatal injuries frequently result from slip-induced falls precipitated by sudden unexpected encounters with low-friction surfaces. Although studies using walking human models have identified some causes of falls and mechanisms underlying slip prevention, it is unclear whether these apply to various locomotor speeds and other species. We used high-speed video and inverse dynamics to investigate the locomotor biomechanics of helmeted guinea fowl traversing slippery surfaces at variable running speeds (1.3-3.6 m s(-1)). Falls were circumvented when limb contact angles exceeded 70 deg, though lower angles were tolerated at faster running speeds ({\textgreater}3.0 m s(-1)). These prerequisites permitted a forward shift of the body's center of mass over the limb's base of support, which kept slip distances below 10 cm (the threshold distance for falls) and maximized the vertical ground reaction forces, thus facilitating limb retraction and the conclusion of the stance phase. These postural control strategies for slip avoidance parallel those in humans, demonstrating the applicability of these strategies across locomotor gaits and the potential for guinea fowl as an insightful model for invasive approaches to understanding limb neuromuscular control on slippery surfaces.},

abstract = {The planar spring-mass model is frequently used to describe bouncing gaits (running, hopping, trotting, galloping) in animal and human locomotion and robotics. Although this model represents a rather simple mechanical system, an analytical solution predicting the center of mass trajectory during stance remains open. We derive an approximate solution in elementary functions assuming a small angular sweep and a small spring compression during stance. The predictive power and quality of this solution is investigated for model parameters relevant to human locomotion. The analysis shows that (i), for spring compressions of up to 20{\%} (angle of attack ???60??, angular sweep ???60??) the approximate solution describes the stance dynamics of the center of mass within a 1{\%} tolerance of spring compression and 0.6??tolerance of angular motion compared to numerical calculations, and (ii), despite its relative simplicity, the approximate solution accurately predicts stable locomotion well extending into the physiologically reasonable parameter domain. (iii) Furthermore, in a particular case, an explicit parametric dependency required for gait stability can be revealed extending an earlier, empirically found relationship. It is suggested that this approximation of the planar spring-mass dynamics may serve as an analytical tool for application in robotics and further research on legged locomotion. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {While legged animals are adept at traversing rough landscapes, it remains a very challenging task for a legged robot to negotiate unknown terrain. Control systems for legged robots are plagued by dynamic constraints from underactuation, actuator power limits, and frictional ground contact; rather than relying purely on disturbance rejection, considerable advantage can be obtained by planning nominal trajectories which are more easily stabilized. In this paper, we present an approach for designing nominal periodic trajectories for legged robots that maximize a measure of robustness against uncertainty in the geometry of the terrain. We propose a direct collocation method which solves simultaneously for a nominal periodic control input, for many possible one-step solution trajectories (using ground profiles drawn from a distribution over terrain), and for the periodic solution to a jump Riccati equation which provides an expected infinite-horizon cost-to-go for each of these samples. We demonstrate that this trajectory optimization scheme can recover the known deadbeat open-loop control solution for the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) on unknown terrain. Moreover, we demonstrate that it generalizes to other models like the bipedal compass gait walker, resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of steps taken over moderate terrain when compared against a limit cycle optimized for efficiency only.},

In this approach, contacts are characterized based on kinematic constraints while the friction forces are simultaneously regularized and incorporated into the formulation. The variables of the resulting linear complementarity problem are only the normal forces. The main advantage of this formulation is that the dimension of the resulting linear complementarity problem is significantly less than its counterpart formulations in the literature, and hence, faster simulations can be achieved.

abstract = {Falls due to slips are prevalent in everyday life. The purpose of this study was to determine the reactive recovery responses used to maintain dynamic stability during an unexpected slip, establish the time course of response adaptation to repeated slip perturbations, and distinguish the proactive strategies for negotiating a slippery surface. Twelve young adults participated in the study in which a slip was generated following foot contact on a set of steel free-wheeling rollers. Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and the medial head of gastrocnemius on the perturbed limb. Whole body kinematics were recorded using an optical imaging system: from this the center of mass, foot angle, and medial-lateral stability margins were determined. In addition, braking/loading and accelerating/unloading impulses while in contact with the rollers and the rate of loading the rollers were determined from ground reaction forces. Results demonstrate that the reactive recovery response to the first slip consisted of a rapid onset of a flexor synergy (146-199 ms), a large arm elevation strategy, and a modified swing limb trajectory. With repeated exposure to the slip perturbation, the CNS rapidly adapts within one slip trial through global changes. These changes include the attenuation of muscle response magnitude, reduced braking impulse, landing more flat-footed, and elevating the center of mass. Individuals implement a "surfing strategy" while on the rollers when knowledge of the surface condition was available before hand. Furthermore, knowledge of a slip results in a reduced braking impulse and rate of loading, a shift in medial-lateral center of mass closer to the support limb at foot contact on the rollers and a more flat foot landing. In conclusion, prior experience with the perturbations allows subsequent modification and knowledge of the surface condition results in proactive adjustments to safely traverse the slippery surface.},

@article{Bhatt2006,
abstract = {The properties of adaptation within the locomotor and balance control systems directed towards improving one's recovery strategy for fall prevention are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine adaptive control of gait stability to repeated slip exposure leading to a reduction in backward loss of balance (and hence in protective stepping). Fourteen young subjects experienced a block of slips during walking. Pre- and post-slip onset stability for all slip trials was obtained as the shortest distance at touchdown (slipping limb) and lift-off (contralateral limb), respectively, between the measured center of mass (COM) state, that is, position and velocity relative to base of support (BOS) and the mathematically predicted threshold for backward loss of balance. An improvement in pre- and post-slip onset stability correlated with a decrease in the incidence of balance loss from 100{\%} (first slip) to 0{\%} (fifth slip). While improvements in pre-slip stability were affected by a proactive anterior shift in COM position, the significantly greater post-slip onset improvements resulted from reductions in BOS perturbation intensity. Such reactive changes in BOS perturbation intensity resulted from a reduction in the demand on post-slip onset braking impulse, which was nonetheless influenced by the proactive adjustments in posture and gait pattern (e.g., the COM position, step length, flat foot landing and increased knee flexion) prior to slip onset. These findings were indicative of the maturing process of the adaptive control. This was characterized by a shift from a reliance on feedback control for postural correction to being influenced by feedforward control, which improved pre-slip stability and altered perturbation intensity, leading to skateover or walkover ({\textgreater}0.05 m or {\textless}0.05 m displacement, respectively) adaptive strategies. Finally, the stability at contralateral limb lift-off was highly predictive of balance loss occurrence and its subsequent rapid reduction, supporting the notion of the internal representations of stability limits that could be modified and updated, as a key component in the adaptive control.},

abstract = {This paper explores the benefits of using multiple gaits in a single robot. Inspired by nature, where humans and animals use different gaits to increase their energetic economy, we analyzed how increasing speed affects the choice of gait, and how the choice of gait influences optimal speed. To this end, we used optimal control as a tool to identify motions that minimize the cost of transport of two detailed models: a planar biped and a planar quadruped. Both of these models are actuated with high compliance series elastic actuators that enable a rich set of natural dynamics. These models have damping in their springs, feet with mass, and realistic limitations on actuator torques and velocities. They therefore serve as an intermediary between past simpler models and hardware. We discovered optimal motions with an established multiple shooting implementation that relies on pre-defined contact sequences, and with a direct collocation implementation in which the footfall pattern was an outcome of the optimization. Both algorithms confirmed findings from biology. For both models, changing gaits as speed varies leads to greatly increased energetic economy. For bipeds, the optimal gaits were walking at low speeds, grounded running at intermediate speeds, and running at high speeds. For quadrupeds, the optimal gaits were four-beat walking at low speeds and trotting at intermediate speeds. At high speeds, galloping and trotting were the best gaits, with nearly equal performance. We found that the transition between gaits was primarily driven by damping losses and negative actuator work, with collisions playing a relatively small role.},

We then propose a per-stride feedback strategy for the hip torque that explicitly compensates for damping losses, reducing the return map to a single dimension and substantially improving the robust stability of fixed points. Subsequent presentation of simulation evidence establishes that the predictions of this approximate model are consistent with the behavior of the exact plant model. We illustrate the relevance and utility of our model both through the qualitative correspondence of its predictions to biological data as well as its use in the design of a task-level running controller.},

The gait exploits the compliance difference between the two sides of the tripods, to generate clockwise or counter clockwise rotation by controlling the acceleration of the robot. The direction of turning depends on the configuration of the legs -tripod left of right- and the direction of the acceleration. Alternating acceleration in successive steps allows for continuous rotation in the desired direction.

abstract = {— Hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) has emerged as a popular framework for dynamic and underactuated bipedal walking, but has significant implementation difficulties when applied to the high degrees of freedom present in humanoid robots. The primary impediment is the process of gait design– it is difficult for optimizers to converge on a viable set of virtual constraints defining a gait. This paper presents a methodology that allows for the fast and reliable generation of efficient multi-contact robotic walking gaits through the framework of HZD, even in the presence of underactuation. To achieve this goal, we unify methods from trajectory optimization with the control framework of multi-domain hybrid zero dynamics. By formulating a novel optimization problem in the context of direct collocation and generating analytic Jacobians for the constraints, solving the resulting nonlinear program becomes tractable for large-scale nonlinear programming solvers, even for systems as high-dimensional as humanoid robots. We experimentally validated our methodology on the spring-legged prototype humanoid, DURUS, showing that the optimization approach yields dynamic and stable 3D walking gaits.},

Initially undergraduates were asked to generate ideas that might be funded by a foundation. Based on this material, ideas displaying different attributes were identified. Another smaller sample of undergraduates were asked to evaluate ideas for funding by the foundation. It was found that people preferred ideas that were easy to understand, provided short-term benefits to many, and were consistent with prevailing social norms, while disregarding risky, time consuming, and original ideas. Original and risky ideas, however, were more likely to be preferred when evaluation criteria were not especially stringent and time pressure was high.

abstract = {Cursorial ground birds are paragons of bipedal running that span a 500-fold mass range from quail to ostrich. Here we investigate the task-level control priorities of cursorial birds by analysing how they negotiate single-step obstacles that create a conflict between body stability (attenuating deviations in body motion) and consistent leg force-length dynamics (for economy and leg safety). We also test the hypothesis that control priorities shift between body stability and leg safety with increasing body size, reflecting use of active control to overcome size-related challenges. Weight-support demands lead to a shift towards straighter legs and stiffer steady gait with increasing body size, but it remains unknown whether non-steady locomotor priorities diverge with size. We found that all measured species used a consistent obstacle negotiation strategy, involving unsteady body dynamics to minimise fluctuations in leg posture and loading across multiple steps, not directly prioritising body stability. Peak leg forces remained remarkably consistent across obstacle terrain, within 0.35 body weights of level running for obstacle heights from 0.1 to 0.5 times leg length. All species used similar stance leg actuation patterns, involving asymmetric force-length trajectories and posture-dependent actuation to add or remove energy depending on landing conditions. We present a simple stance leg model that explains key features of avian bipedal locomotion, and suggests economy as a key priority on both level and uneven terrain. We suggest that running ground birds target the closely coupled priorities of economy and leg safety as the direct imperatives of control, with adequate stability achieved through appropriately tuned intrinsic dynamics.},

abstract = {In physics-based animation linear complementarity problems (LCPs) have historically been used as models of contact forces between rigid bodies. Recently LCPs are being deployed for other types of animation like deformable models, fluids, and granular material. Thus, LCPs are becoming a general important fundamental model. Hence, there is a real need for providing the numerical foundation for solving LCPs with numerical methods that are suitable for computer graphics. This is the void that these course notes tries to fill out-providing a toolbox of solutions for people in physics-based animation. The contribution of these notes is twofold. First, we explain the nature of LCPs and discuss the properties of the LCPs encountered in physics-based animation. Second, we present a range of numerical methods for solving the LCPs. To help make our results available to others we supplement our course notes with Matlab implementations of all iterative methods discussed.},

abstract = {Swing-leg retraction was introduced as a way to improve the stability and disturbance rejection of running robots. It was also suggested that the reduced foot speed due to swing-leg retraction can help reduce impact energy losses, decrease peak forces, and minimize foot slipping. However, the extent to which swing-leg retraction rate influences all these benefits was unknown. In this paper, we present a study on the effect of swing-leg retraction rate on these benefits. The results of this study show that swing-leg retraction can indeed improve the performance of running robots in all of the suggested areas. However, the results also show that, for moderate and high running speeds, the optimal retraction rate for maximal disturbance rejection and stability is different from the optimal retraction rate for minimal impact losses, peak forces, and foot slipping. This discrepancy indicates an inherent tradeoff to consider when selecting the retraction rate for a robot control system: in general, retraction rate can be optimized for better stability and disturbance rejection or for more favorable efficiency, impact forces, and footing stability, but not all simultaneously. Furthermore, this tradeoff becomes more severe as running speed increases.},

abstract = {Although much has been learned in recent decades about the deterioration of muscular strength, gait adaptations, and sensory degradation among older adults, little is known about how these intrinsic changes affect biomechanical parameters associated with slip-induced fall accidents. In general, the objective of this laboratory study was to investigate the process of initiation, detection, and recovery of inadvertent slips and falls. We examined the initiation of and recovery from foot slips among three age groups utilizing biomechanical parameters, muscle strength, and sensory measurements. Forty-two young, middle-age, and older participants walked around a walking track at a comfortable pace. Slippery floor surfaces were placed on the track over force platforms at random intervals without the participants' awareness. Results indicated that younger participants slipped as often as the older participants, suggesting that the likelihood of slip initiation is similar across all age groups; however, older individuals' recovery process was much slower and less effective. The ability to successfully recover from a slip (thus preventing a fall) is believed to be affected by lower extremity muscle strength and sensory degradation among older individuals. Results from this research can help pinpoint possible intervention strategies for improving dynamic equilibrium among older adults.},

abstract = {Hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) has emerged as a popular framework for the stable control of bipedal robotic gaits, but typically designing a gait's virtual constraints is a slow and undependable optimization process. To expedite and boost the reliability of HZD gait generation, we borrow methods from trajectory optimization to formulate a smoother and more linear optimization problem. We present a multiple-shooting formulation for the optimization of virtual constraints, combining the stability-friendly properties of HZD with an optimization-conducive problem formulation. To showcase the implications of this recipe for improving gait generation, we use the same process to generate periodic planar walking gaits on two different robot models, and in one case, demonstrate stable walking on the hardware prototype, DURUS-R.},

abstract = {Advanced grasp control algorithms could benefit greatly from accurate tracking of the object as well as an accurate all-around knowledge of the system when the robot attempts a grasp. This motivates our study of the G-SL(AM) 2 problem, in which two goals are simultaneously pursued: object tracking relative to the hand and estimation of parameters of the dynamic model. We view the G-SL(AM) 2 problem as a filtering problem. Because of stick-slip friction and collisions between the object and hand, suitable dynamic models exhibit strong nonlinearities and jump discontinuities. This fact makes Kalman filters (which assume linearity) and extended Kalman filters (which assume differentiability) inapplicable, and leads us to develop a particle filter. An important practical problem that arises during grasping is occlusion of the view of the object by the robot's hand. To combat the resulting loss of visual tracking fidelity, we designed a particle filter that incorporates tactile sensor data. The filter is evaluated off-line with data gathered in advance from grasp acquisition experiments conducted with a planar test rig. The results show that our particle filter performs quite well, especially during periods of visual occlusion, in which it is much better than the same filter without tactile data.},

abstract = {We investigate an experiential learning paradigm for acquiring an internal model of intuitive physics. Our model is evaluated on a real-world robotic manipulation task that requires displacing objects to target locations by poking. The robot gathered over 400 hours of experience by executing more than 100K pokes on different objects. We propose a novel approach based on deep neural networks for modeling the dynamics of robot's interactions directly from images, by jointly estimating forward and inverse models of dynamics. The inverse model objective provides supervision to construct informative visual features, which the forward model can then predict and in turn regularize the feature space for the inverse model. The interplay between these two objectives creates useful, accurate models that can then be used for multi-step decision making. This formulation has the additional benefit that it is possible to learn forward models in an abstract feature space and thus alleviate the need of predicting pixels. Our experiments show that this joint modeling approach outperforms alternative methods.},

We are particularly interested in robotic manipulation tasks, which are especially hard due to the non-linear nature of contact phenomena. We developed a solution that solves both the problems of estimation and system identification jointly. We show that these two problems are difficult to solve separately in the presence of discontinuous phenomena such as contacts. The problem is posed as a joint optimization across both trajectory and model parameters and solved via Newton's method. We present several challenges we encountered while modeling contacts and performing state estimation and propose solutions within the MuJoCo physics engine. We present experimental results performed on our manipulation system consisting of 3-DOF Phantom Haptic Devices, turned into finger manipulators. Cross-validation between different datasets, as well as leave-one-out cross-validation show that our method is robust and is able to accurately explain sensory data.},

abstract = {We describe a new physics engine tailored to model-based control. Multi-joint dynamics are represented in generalized coordinates and computed via recursive algorithms. Contact responses are computed via efficient new algorithms we have developed, based on the modern velocity-stepping approach which avoids the difficulties with spring-dampers. Models are specified using either a high-level C++ API or an intuitive XML file format. A built-in compiler transforms the user model into an optimized data structure used for runtime computation. The engine can compute both forward and inverse dynamics. The latter are well-defined even in the presence of contacts and equality constraints. The model can include tendon wrapping as well as actuator activation states (e.g. pneumatic cylinders or muscles). To facilitate optimal control applications and in particular sampling and finite differencing, the dynamics can be evaluated for different states and controls in parallel. Around 400,000 dynamics evaluations per second are possible on a 12-core machine, for a 3D homanoid with 18 dofs and 6 active contacts. We have already used the engine in a number of control applications. It will soon be made publicly available.},
